"Martempering is well established as a method by which the stresses and strains generated during the quenching of a steel component may be controlled. In this process the component is held at an intermediate temperature in a salt bath subsequent to the initial cooling from the austenitization temperature, but prior to the final quench to ambient. This allows sufficient time for most of the temperature gradient in the component to be eliminated before the transformation of the austenite to martensite in the final stages of the cooling process. It is essential that the intermediate treatment does not cause decomposition of the austenite by diffusional processes, to form soft transformation products. This limits the time available for the intermediate treatment. Doubts have been raised about the fundamental assumptions on which the process is based, since the absence of a vapour blanket stage in the initial cool in the salt bath produces very high surface heat transfer coefficients at the start of the process, when the material is very soft. It has been the purpose of the present investigation to verify these assumptions by the use of a mathematical model of the stress generation process. In the case of 835M30 steel, 87 seconds at 450°C reduced the temperature gradient in a 15 mm thick plate to 5°C, without producing any diffusional decomposition to soft structures. However, the beneficial effect of this small temperature gradient during the later stages of the process, was negated as far as strain was concerned by the increased distortion that occurred in the very early part of the cooling process in the salt bath. This latter effect was due to the very large surface heat transfer coefficient provided by the quenchant at this stage. The martempering operation, however, did successfully remove the thermal stresses by the time the component reached ambient. Modification of the process to include an oil quench from the salt bath was not beneficial, as the stresses and strains produced at the end of the quench were very similar to those produced by a conventional oil quench from the austenitization temperature. The calculated residual stress and strain distributions were checked against the corresponding experimental values. Agreement was reasonably good, except for a small but uniform discrepancy in the case of the strains. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper is the third in a series of publications by Abdel-Malek (1986, InlernationalJournal of Production Research, 24, 1025-1041) and Abdel-Malek and Boucher (1985, International Journal of Production Research, 23, 197-208). It extends the previous work to cover the concept of robotic assembly while conveyor tracking (RACT). Analytical models are developed to aid the application engineers to depict the effect of RACT implementation on the assembly process throughput. The models also help in assessing the susceptibility of the RACT concept to the different design parameters and its economic feasibility. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The application of robots to industrial assembly processes raises issues of robot selection and product design which are just beginning to be addressed in the research literature.

"This paper addresses one of the operational problems associated with the application of robots to industrial systems: the optimum sequencing of robotic task performance. The application of inverse kinematics in determining the sequence that minimizes the cycle time in a robot cell is described. An extension of the Travelling Salesman Algorithm is found to be suitable for obtaining the optimum sequence and cycle time. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a sequel of a paper entitled: 'A framework for the economic evaluation of production system and product design alternatives for robot assembly' (Abdel- Malek and Boucher 1985). The previous work introduced guidelines for the robotic assembly of a 'peg-in-a-hole'. This paper extends the previous work to cover the robotic assembly of parts with general geometries. The paper analyses the effect of the different parameters involved in the robotic assembly process on its feasibility. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.,1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The paper develops an expert systems approach to define appropriate layouts of machining facilities under specific combinations of manufacturing and materials handling systems. The knowledge base incorporates six factors relating product variety and quantity, degrees of flexibility, level of automation, materials handling system, work-in-process and environmental considerations. The EXSYS system program has been used to manipulate the knowledge base. The program operates in tandem mode and interfaces with algorithms to optimize the selection of materials handling equipment, and generate appropriate layouts. Application of the program is illustrated for an existing facility. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The paper indicates the limitations on improved performance arising from physical effort and from information handling and outlines the role of training in improving job performance. Changes in jobs indicate that physical limitations will play less and less part but that other areas of job knowledge will be needed. In particular, the developments in job design may call for radically different areas of training than formerly. © 1971, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A model is.proposed for the systematic arrangement of work element times. This model consists of a grouping of all work element times along the time co-ordinate either in groups of equal size or with the time span of each group increasing with the mean time of each group. The statistical properties in analysing work by means of data thus arranged are investigated. A comparison is madewith the sampling error.of.such, data, the observational error, when the error consists of referring the work elements to the wrong group, and the natural variation of the performance time. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1967,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The accuracy of physiological work studies depends only in part on the measuring instrument itself. If the measurement is performed on work which is insufficiently described, the total accuracy of the measurement is decreased. A proper selection of description variables increases the accuracy of physiological work measurement and makes a fairly general prediction of the energy expenditure possible. A model for prediction of energy expenditure from physical data is proposed and has been tested in a number of industrial cases. The accuracy of the result is of the same order of magnitude as a good work study.© 1967 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.",1967,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper presents an approximate method for the analysis of transfer lines composed of unreliable machines linked by an unreliable transportation system carrying a limited number of transportation devices (conveyor carrying pallets, wire guided carts, etc.). We are interested in defining the productivity of the system with regard to the characteristics of the system and, in particular, the number of transportation devices. The result of the study is a formula which gives the productivity of the system according to the transportation devices available and the mean breakdown times of the machines and the transportation system. A comparison is made with simulation results showing the accuracy of the formula at least for the main usual breakdown and working period distributions. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The control of an equipment-intensive production system in the electronics industry is a very complicated task due to the complex process flow, especially the necessity for several loop sequences of the same processes. This paper describes the development of a pattern-recognition-oriented control-decision support system (CDSS) in order to set the best control strategy and an application for a circuit board fabrication system. The CDSS has been designed to be flexible to adapt to a change of market demands. This procedure is based on the state table concept. A combined discrete-event/process-interaction simulation model for the production system has been developed in order to provide basic data for the CDSS. The simulation analysis evaluates the alternatives of the control strategy on the efficiency performances, such as throughput and WIP. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The coordination of production and inventory decisions for raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods is important. We compare some decision rules for a ‘firm that uses a single raw material to manufacture n different parts which are then assembled into the final product. Demand for the final product is probabilistic and there are costs of holding inventory and of ordering, manufacture and assembly. These characteristics are an idealization of the problem faced by a manufacturer of scaffolds in which the major processes are the manufacture of different sheet metal parts and their assembly.We develop production rules that use system-wide information. We use simulation to evaluate the performance of these rules and compare system behaviour to that under production rules that are derived separately for each item and use only local information about that item's status. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on the feasible set approach, a location-allocation model is established in this study for oil palm production in Nigeria. This model determines the number, capacities and locations of the processing units and the allocation of the various oil palm products so that the total cost incurred is minimized. The model incorporates a processing unit dropping routine, node creation routine and a forcing technique. With the relevant data collected in Nigeria, cost-minimizing results are obtained using the model, and the robustness of the model is verified by sensitivity analysis. © 1982 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Results are presented of experiments with a simulation model of an actual make-for-stock shop, in which both the scheduling and due-date updating decision rules were varied and the effect on a cost function observed. A marked interaction between the rules occurred in some cases. One of the due-date updating rules, which does not appear to have been used previously, had the effect of advancing or retarding the due date of a batch as it passed through the shop in response to the difference between the actual and expected demand for the product. This rule was found to perform well when used in combination with a due-date-based scheduling rule. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A series of experiments is reported in which the demand forecasting method used in a simulation model of an actual make-for-stock shop was varied, and the resulting impact on a cost function observed. The forecasting models employed were all of the multiple exponential smoothing type. Reducing the smoothing constant, i.e. changing the filtering characteristics, was found to lead to statistically significant cost savings across the full range of experimental conditions examined. However, the effect of increasing the order of the forecasting model, i.e. changing the assumption about the nature of the demand time series, was found to be sensitive to the stock-out cost rate used, with both increases and decreases in cost occurring. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A simulation model, driven by real order time series, of an actual make-forstock shop is described. A broad spectrum of different sets of decision rules has been incorporated in the model in an attempt to represent as many as possible of the production controls which might be utilized by a production manager. Experiments designed to determine the impact on a production cost function of changes in decision rules can be conducted over a wide range of conditions, with the objective of assessing the robustness of rule changes. To illustrate the use of the model, the results of experiments in two areas of production control are presented. Changing the stock control policy used by the host company to a re-order level policy type was shown to lead to significant improvements in performance across the range of conditions examined, in the case of a low marginal cost of stock review. In experiments with leadtime setting rules, improvements in performance were obtained across the spectrum of experimental conditions when the leadtime distribution was altered to one based on batch work content and number of operations and the tightness of the mean leadtime was simultaneously increased. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this paper we are concerned with a key element for the effective utilization of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), namely the design of the physical layout. This problem involves finding which processing modules should be adjacent to each other and how they should be connected with the transfer links of the material handling system to minimize the material handling requirements. These requirements also impact on in-process storage space, work-in-process inventories, the cost of control, and throughput time. We first characterize mathematically the static problem where all part attributes are constant over time. We then proceed to analyse the dynamic problem, where changes in system characteristics (such as the part mix manufactured by the FMS), can cause a substantial increase in material handling requirements, thereby indicating a need to consider a relayout. We examine the influence of a number of system parameters on several relayout strategies and derive guidelines for FMS relayout based on a series of experiments with realistic size problems. Our results indicate that a decrease of up to 36% in performance capability occurs for some relayout strategies when compared to the best strategy. Much of this substantial loss in effectiveness can be avoided by minimal, yet timely, machine rearrangement. Our findings can guide decision makers vis-á-vis their own systems where actual system relayout costs can be used. The paper concludes with directions for further research. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper is based on a critical analysis of 27 published case-studies on productivity improvement efforts. First, the paper emphasizes why productivity is important for individual companies, for organizations as well as for nations, and outlines the most commonly used definitions and measures of productivity. Next, the paper attempts to identify all the productivity-related factors mentioned in the case-studies, and puts them under various groups of factors in such a way that each group falls under the general responsibility of one of the traditional functional managers. Further, the paper gives a critical review of commonly used, specialized productivity measures as they exist in the various U.S. industry groups, such as manufacturing, government, service industry, and others. An additional two sections are devoted to the critical assessment of the major contributors to productivity, and to the uncontrollable situations (statesof nature) that can damage productivity efforts. These two sections are followed by a focus on common problems in measuring productivity and on the misdirected efforts of certain companies or organizations. Next, the paper proposed an all-encompassing composite measure of productivity for the benefit of managers, and also outlines a sequence of essential steps that must be accomplished to obtain excellent productivity results from investment in improvement efforts. Finally, the paper underlines those precautions and safeguards without which most productivity efforts can end in futility. This section also outlines a philosophy for productivity personnel, which is—“Productivity improvement is an organic, effort-needing, time-consuming, and ongoing process.”. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this paper, a composite cost-oriented priority scheduling rule is compared to three other well-known rules, that are basically time-oriented. The criteria used for comparison include: total cost per job, number of late jobs, machine utilization, in-process inventory and the number of late jobs in-process. Repeated measures analysis of variance is used and followed by mean comparisons. Results suggest that SPT and cost rides are preferred in most of the criteria. © 1973 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A recent work obtained closed-form solutions to the.problem of optimally grouping a multi-item inventory into subgroups with a common order cycle per group, when the distribution by value of the inventory could be described by a Pareto function. This paper studies the sensitivity of the optimal subgroup boundaries so obtained. Closed-form expressions have been developed to find intervals for the subgroup boundaries for any given level of suboptimality. Graphs have been provided to aid the user in selecting a cost-effective level of aggregation and choosing appropriate subgroup boundaries for a whole range of inventory distributions. The results of sensitivity analyses demonstrate the availability of flexibility in the partition boundaries and the cost-effectiveness of any stock control system through three groups, and thus also provide a theoretical support to the intuitive ABC system of classifying the items. © 1984 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"‘Measurement’ usually gives an impression of things being measured objectively, accurately and usually with the help of an instrument. However, this is not always possible. How does one measure the attitude of a government, strength of a tea blend or relative weights of different objectives? These can only be measured subjectively, by one or more experts or judges. When measurement is based on subjective evaluations by several judges, a method is required to combine them into a single judgement. Each method has its merits and demerits and the one most appropriate for a situation may be selected. When subjective measurement is made by a single judge, no one can alter it because the judge alone is authorised to evaluate. However, the problem arises when some of the inferences drawn from this judgement contradict each other. It has been widely accepted that this is a common problem and methods have been devised to bring about clarity and consistency in the judgement made by a judge. The work on this subject has been done in various disciplines and lacks common nomenclature. This restricts the use of a method to the discipline for which it has been developed, even though similar problems may exist in other disciplines. Also, a method should achieve consistency in judgement without changing the judgement too much, which is not always the case. This paper attempts to structure the problem of subjective measurement by a single judge, understand the role of methods in improving it and presents two methods of improving subjective measurement by a single judge in ratio scale. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The typical assembly line is serial with no paralleling of work elements and work stations allowed. The series assumption restricts the least cycle time to be the maximum work element time, thus limiting the production rate. An alternative way to increase the production rate (hence lowering the cycle time) is by assigning multiple workers to one work station. In this paper we propose the parallel assignment method (PAM) for achieving a higher production rate. In the first phase of PAM the work elements are assigned to work stations under the multi-stage upper time limits. But as two or more workers are assigned to one station, the operation time of each worker is longer in proportion to the number of workers at the station. Therefore, in the second phase of PAM work elements are assigned to the workers in each station so that each of the workers may perform shorter work elements where the work element is a minimum rational indivisible work item. Practical problems which cannot he solved by serial line balancing methods are provided and.solved to explain the effectiveness of PAM. © 1983 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this paper, we develop a linear programming framework for computing a quadratic approximation to the value function, which constitutes the off-line computation of a hierarchical FMS scheduling approach previously developed by us. In contrast to previous work, where relatively crude value functions were used, we develop a quadratic approximation that is a prior fit. We consider the multiple part multiple machine discounted cost case and illustrate the approach via a simulation example in the context of an industrial setting. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper discusses AI-oriented production management systems using object oriented programming. The two pilot systems described here are both implemented using the Smalltalk-80 programming environment. One of the systems concerns production planning in dairy industries, while the other is a simulation tool for production flow analysis. The merits of object oriented programming in the design of the user interfaces are emphasised. The flexibility of the object oriented approach for stepwise development has been observed. Simulation method as a communication tool is used in both systems and the applicability of Smalltalk in simulation is demonstrated. Design effectiveness and efficiency has proven surprisingly good. The experiences introduced in the paper are based on two geographically disjoint research groups, having thus impact on the generality of the observations made. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"An adaptive control algorithm is formulated which provides, in real time, an optimal adjustment to a controller Bet-point in response to changes in the operating characteristics of the process. Such an algorithm is applicable to a variety of industrial processes: for example, those in which the product is either a containerized consumable or a sheet of some type. A Bayesian model is developed for the univariate case and the optimal control policy found. Multivariate extensions are also considered, as is the problem of process overhaul. © 1977, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper presents a conceptual framework towards the development of a mathematical model of a production system. The framework is functional, and it is designed to permit a rational mathematical formulation of the transient and steady state operation of production systems. The boundaries and nature of a generalized production system are defined with reference to the organization system and environmental systems. The sub-systems and component functions of the production system are then defined and classified in terms of trees, stages, streams, levels, and components. The dimensions and units necessary for a quantitative analysis of the streams, levels, and components are defined. The types of mathematical relationships pertinent in defining the system operating functions are described and typical resulting equations presented. © 1963 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

An empirical equation has been obtained for calculating the required loads and an attempt has been made to interpret this equation in terms of rubber hardness and the work-hardening characteristic of the metal.

"Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) has been recognized as playing a key role in Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM). In the last two decades, a tremendous effort has been made in developing CAPP systems. However, the benefits of CAPP in the real industrial environment are still to be seen. In this paper, a comprehensive summary on the state-of-the-art and projection of future trends in CAPP is presented to help make decisions concerning CAPP implementation today and to aid in guiding research for tomorrow. We systematically overview the historical background of the development of CAPP and discuss the current techniques which includes the implementation approaches, GT technology, application of AI techniques, programming languages, etc., for implementation CAPP systems. About 14 well-known CAPP systems, which are based on the variant, generative or semi-generative approach, are briefly introduced in this paper. In total about 156 currently existing CAPP systems are listed in Table 1 in the appendix. Table 1 provides the general information of the existing systems, such as the characteristics of the systems, the domain of planable workpieces, implementation approaches, commercial situation, interfacing abilities, programming languages, references, and developers, etc. Future trends proposed in this paper covers the topics about interfacing, integration, AI techniques, and single data base systems, as well as PC, workstations and software migration strategy, etc., which might be used to guide coming research.

"In this paper we present two new dispatching rules for minimizing tardiness in a job shop. Both rules are closely related to the modified operation due date (MOD) rule. The first is a combination of the shortest processing time (SPT) rule and the critical ratio (CR) rule, and the second is a combination of the SPT rule and the slack per remaining work (S/RPT) rule. The two new rules are simple to implement and can easily be adapted to minimize weighted tardiness. Moreover they do not require any parameter estimation for their implementation, which is a notable disadvantage of some earlier rules such as COVERT. Simulation results show that the performance of the two new rules is better than that of other rules that have been developed to minimize total weighted and unweighted tardiness. This holds true across a range of shop conditions. Furthermore, the rules are effective in minimizing the number of tardy jobs. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper deals with improvements in manufacturing effectiveness found possible through examination of design and machining requirements for light mechanical/electrical lifting equipment, manufactured on a batch basis. Value analysis and value engineering concepts were applied to the design of a small overhead travelling trolley. The aim of the value analysis was to achieve maximum savings from modifications to the existing design, whilst that of value engineering was the development of a conceptually-new design directed towards minimum manufacturing cost. The potential changes and savings from both approaches are described. In the machine shop capacity study, components were first coded and classified by the VUOSO system and a representative sample, by value, taken as the basis for the process planning investigation. By reference to revised machining methods, standard data, and the maximum use of special tooling, jigs, fixtures and carbide tooling, a possible average reduction in machining time of approximately 48% was indicated. Using the sampling approach as a basis for assessment of improvement potential led to the suggestion that an increase in output approaching 70% would be an appropriate target using existing machine tools. © 1979 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper reports on a simulation study of hierarchical planning methods, which can be utilized in connection with material requirements planning. The company considered produces one final product having a complex structure. The factory is functionally organized. Two different cases have been studied. In the first case there were both seasonal and independent stochastic variations in demand and in the second case only stochastic variations. Aggregate decisions are based on a simple model in which all items are aggregated into one product group and all machines into one machine group. The aggregate plan is disaggregated by changing the detailed production plans obtained from the material requirements planning system. Two different methods involving changes of order release times and changes of order quantities have been used. Simulation results indicate that even very simple hierarchical planning processes can give significant cost reductions compared to using material requirements planning based on predicted demand. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A new paradigm is proposed for the realization of computer integrated production management. Computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) can never be constructed just by combining the automated devices available at present, such as CAD, CAM, CAPP and MRP systems. To realize successful CIM, the automation of friendly communication between experts is required, which plays a most important role in the integration of the various functions of production management. This points to the importance of computer integrated production management. In order to confirm the validity of the paradigm proposed in this paper, a prototype in process planning has been developed which aims at integration with CAD. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In layout planning the concept of ‘flow dominance’—the situation in which relatively few paths of flow dominate the overall materials movement problem— has been recognized for many years as a guide to whether line layout may be effective. More recently, so-called upper and lower bounds on flow dominance and a parameter‘problem complexity’ based on these bounds have been proposed as being more informative than flow dominance alone. In this paper it is shown that these so-called upper and lower bounds are only bounding values under certain conditions. A new parameter, ‘flow complexity’, is proposed which more effectively measures the complexity of flow. This parameter has a value which does lie between two bounds, one of which implies a pure flow line situation, the other the pure job shop situation. © 1983 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Accumulation of knowledge in and practical experience of simple flowlines and group technology flowlines indicates that no comprehensive classification of the alternative configurations is available. Those developed in the mass production context do not sufficiently reflect the possibilities in group systems, while those quoted in the group technology context tend to be superficial This paper is aimed at overcoming this problem. It integrates all the varieties of flowlines into one classification scheme.

"In designing a multi-product flowline, problem of material handling and workilow arise on one hand and of machine utilization on the other. Because of variations in the number of operations on parts and in their operation sequences, a sequence of machines that satisfies one particular family of parts is unlikely to satisfy all the other families. On the other hand, if a sequence is generated to accommodate all the families of parta, a simple flowline is unlikely. This is the problem of the layout of multi-product flowlines. Most of the solution techniques available are for the single-machine case which is a restricted aapect of the problem. Solution of the general machine case has received very little attention in the literature. This paper considers all the facets of the problem. It advances a solution technique baaed on the link-analysis or travel-charting method. The technique is all embracing and hence can be tailored to satisfy the requirements of either a single machine or the general machine situation. Manual implementation of the design algorithm ia illustrated by an example. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Problems of workload imbalance in Group Technology (GT) can be mitigated by transferring workloads from a congested machine centre in one cell to an alternative, less congested machine centre in another cell. Such inter-cell workload transfer results in a GT system which is a hybrid between pure GT (in which components are. completely processed within a cell) and functional layout (FL) (in which components are routed from one department of similar machines to another until completely processed) Though inter-cell workload transfer is often used in practice, its effects on system performance in GT have not been evaluated. This paper describes a general purpose GT simulator which has been developed and the evaluation of workload transfer which has been carried out (Aug 1981). Various job and cell attributes are employed as criteria for initiating workload transfers and the results of such transfers are examined in terms of job satisfaction, scheduling effort and material handling as well as overall shop performance. The interacting effects of job allocation rules, priority dispatching rules and batch overlapping are investigated under varying degrees of deviation from ‘pure’ GT. The effects of changes in job mix and of increases in demand are also examined. So are the effects of unbalanced capacity and cell size.

"Recently, Just-In-Time (JIT) purchasing practices have been recognized as a cornerstone of Japan's success in improving product quality and productivity. Traditionally, however, US firms have treated purchasing functions as a ‘profit centre’. This paper presents the proposition that US firms must recognize the potential of purchasing activities as ‘quality and productivity centres’ through successful implementation of JIT purchasing. Personal interviews have been conducted at four US manufacturing firms in an effort, first, to identify the major activities of JIT purchasing that have favourable effects on product quality and productivity and, second, to describe how these activities can improve product quality and productivity in US firms. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper presents an implementation of a decomposition-coordination approach to petroleum refinery production scheduling. In this approach the scheduling problem is not formulated as a single mathematical programming model to be solved through a computerized system, but it is dealt with as a mathematical programming process, in which a number of small problems are practically solved, and their solutions are combined into an overall schedule Our approach does not pursue an exact optimum, but quite satisfactory schedules have been generated from a practical viewpoint and productivity in the scheduling process has been remarkably raised An interactive computerized scheduling system has been tailored using a commercial MPS and its Extended Control Language (ECL). The man-hours required for making a final schedule has been reduced to one-third as compared with the previous way. © 1983 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"COMSOAL, an acronym for a computer Method of Sequencing Operations for Assembly Lines, is a method of balancing large complex machine-paced assembly lines. Basically, by means of a high-speed digital computer, sampled data is used for Monte-Carlo simulation of the proposed designs. COMSOAL originated in an industrial operations research project and is in use at some factories of the Chrysler Corporation in an early form. The latest version, described here, awaits implementation in the factory situation. First, the problem is analyzed in simple form and two solutions are offered, with several results, arising from applications to situations with up to 1000 tasks. The analysis is then extended and solutions to the complex form, which includes eight typical additional constraints, mixed production and stochastic considerations, are presented. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1965,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is assumed that the diameter is a normally distributed variable that exhibits a linear trend in the process mean.

"An experimental technique had been developed for studying cutting with single tools of known geometry at very small depths of cut. It has been shown that the specific cutting energy decreases as the thickness of the cut is decreased, a result which is contrary to that obtained in previous investigations with grinding wheels and to that expected from consideration of the influence of specimen size on the yield value of shear stress.

"The paper gives a qualitative treatment of a new approach to the synthesis of sequential control systems. Complex sequential control systems can be assembled from a relatively small number of standard sequence packages. These have useful sequential properties in their own right, but the methods for coupling them together to form larger sequential systems are described by the authors. Additional benefit is gained by using the machine actuators alone as memory devices. This removes any possibility of unintentional disturbance of the state of the memory function in the control system. Three examples are chosen to illustrate the design process. © 1971 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considerable experimentation is conducled to study the statistical characteristics of this approach and to compare results with those obtained by complete or partial enumeration.

"The shop scheduling problem with which this paper is concerned is to determine a sequence of J jobs on each of the M machines such that the schedule time is minimized. The machine ordering of each job is pre-specified but independent of those of other jobs. A branch-and-bound algorithm, using a powerful bounding procedure, has been developed for obtaining an optimal solution. An illustrative example is solved. Computational experience with this algorithm shows that it is practical in problems of moderate size. However, for larger problems, the algorithm can be applied without backtracking in which an optimal or near-optimal solution may be obtained. The quality of solutions obtained by the branch-and-bound algorithm without backtracking has been investigated. The optimal-producing algorithm is compared favourably with other published methods The number of nodes explored and the computational time are considered as bases for evaluation. © 1973 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper proposes a mathematical model and solution procedure for the group technology configuration problem—the grouping of individual machines into cells and the routing of components to machines within cells. Costs of inventory, machine depreciation, machine setup and material handling are first incorporated into a mathematical programming formulation. The formulation is then divided into two subproblems to facilitate solution. A heuristic graph partitioning procedure is then proposed for each subproblem. The first subproblem assigns components to specific machines. The second subproblem groups machines into cells. An approach for determining economic batch sizes in this environment is also included. Examples are included and the flexibility of the approach to various environments is discussed. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Group technology is a management philosophy capable of jointly simplifying management control and improving productivity. This paper proposes a heuristic approach to the economic determination of machine groups and their corresponding component families for group technology. The procedure considers coste of work-in-process and cycle inventory, intra-group material handling, set-up, variable processing and fixed machine costs. The three stage procedure initially reorders part types based on routing similarity. An attempt is then made to combine adjacent part types to reduce machine requirements. Finally groups are combined where economic benefits of utilization offset those of set-up, work-in- process and material handling.

"An exploratory model for cutting is presented which incorporates fracture toughness as well as the commonly considered effects of plasticity and friction. The periodic load fluctuations Been in cutting force dynamometer tests are predicted, and considerations of chatter and surface finish follow. A non-dimensional group is put forward to classify different regimes of material response to machining. It leads to tentative explanations for the difficulties of cutting materials such as ceramics and brittlo polymers, and also relates to the formation of discontinuous chips. Experiments on a range of solids with widely varying toughness/strength ratios generally agree with the analysis. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The paper reviews problems encountered when using overhung boring bars fitted with single point tooling for profile boring operations. Above certain length to diameter ratios, which are affected by the diameter of the bars and the base fixing conditions, the stiffness is inadequate permitting the build-up of unstable vibrations and making it difficult to maintain accuracy of the form of the bore. Approximate design rules are given for steel boring bars, bars fitted with shanks made in materials with a high modulus of elasticity, and for bars fitted with simple dampers. The paper concludes with a brief description of possible new methods of damping boring bars and of the problems of devising simple but acceptable mathematical models representing the dynamic system. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The optimal reorder point and reorder quantity are calculated to minimize the sum of holding, set-up, and stock out costs, where the stock out cost is simply the expense of expediting the manufacturing lead time. It is argued that this cost model is applicable in many real-world manufacturing situations, and it has the great advantage of using cost coefficients which can be roughly estimated. In addition, formulas are given for the 'implied' and 'critical' charge for expediting, the latter being defined as the point below which it doesn't pay to carry safety (buffer) stock. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"An aggregate lot-sizing policy is introduced into the production planning function which determines how lot sizes, as calculated by the formulae normally used by a given company, should be dynamically increased or decreased for each individual period over the planning horizon. The problem is solved by modifying the standard linear programming model used in production planning. Setup costs are not used. Rather, the effects of setups in the model are to reduce available capacity while also lowering the inventories necessary to operate the business.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the near future many companies will face the problem of the optimal use of newly installed manufacturing technology (e.g. a flexible manufacturing system or FMS). Very often this will involve decisions on what parts to produce using the new system (the part mix problem) and how to produce these parts (the routing mix problem). We show that traditional operational research tools such as linear programming and queueing network theory are well suited to tackle these problems. In particular, LP models are combined with queueing network models in an iterative procedure. As such the strengths of both techniques can be exploited in making optimal use of the part mix and routing mix flexibility of the FMS. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondly, it points out that the Naidu-Singh procedure attempts to find the cheapest path in a certain acyclic network whose nodes are sets of periods and where the kth cheapest path does not necessarily have any node in common with 2nd or 3rd or. . . or (k-1)st-cheapest path.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In most cases real world subsystems for inventory and production control are designed according to very elementary control principles. In order to control the total system, some kind of coordinating control of the subsystems is needed. The approach pursued in this paper is to control the over-all-system by varying different control-parameters of the subsystems. The control system is therefore regarded as a two-level hierarchical system. Coordinating control is carried out with the aid of simple dynamic models based on aggregate terms. Problems concerning the identification of inventory-dynamics ore highlighted. In order to show how the models developed can be used efficiently for coordinating the control of an integrated production-inventory system, a simple control principle is applied to a simulated system. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When production orders are initiated by an inventory control system the production load daring a given time period can be looked upon as a random variable. When order quantities are large the variations in production load can be a severe problem. One way to smooth the variations in the load is to use smaller order quantities than those given by traditional lot sizing techniques. This is in practice done with the aid of simple rules of thumb. In this paper we describe a model for determining order quantities when the cost of a varying production load is recognized. The required production capacity is defined by a small given probability for overload during the time period regarded. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Ltd.,1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper eals with the dynamics of a computer-based inventory control system. In general Buch a real-life system is designed according to the most basic principles of static inventory theory. To control the system in a dynamic sense, management has to vary the policy parameters of the system. Two different mathematical models of inventory dynamics are introduced. The first ie a simple first-order differential equation and the second a discrete multidimensional model.

"The throughput capacity of an automated warehousing system is mainly dependent on two factors; the number of available storage spaces and the efficiency of the storage and retrieval system. If it is assumed that only a limited amount of resources are available to build a warehouse, spending most of the resources on providing more spaces or on a more efficient storage and retrieval system becomes a crucial allocation problem. In this paper, a warehouse consisting of two types of storage spaces, random access and rack space, is considered. Random access spaces are assumed to require more resources per unit to provide, but they contribute more to the efficiency of the operation of the system because items can be stored in and retrieved from them without delay. Rack spaces, on the other hand, need the services of a stacking crane for storage and retrieval. As a result, the queueing system formed limits their utilization. Here, a method is presented for the optimum allocation of the resources among these two types of spaces so that the overall throughput capacity of the warehouse is maximized. The problem is formulated and solved as a stochastic optimization problem and a numerical example is provided. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper outlines a method for the evaluation of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), which considers both economics and strategic aspects. The firm strategic position, in fact, is turned into a few performance indicators, each expressed numerically. The manufacturing system must perform within given values of these indicators, which act as constraints. Then connections between the cost of obtaining strategic performances and the flexibility of the manufacturing system are defined; this allows one to express net cash flows, used to compute profitability, as a function of the strategic position of the firm. The simplifying assumptions used in implementing the method on a VAX/VMS are specified.

"In inventory planning, the use of exponential smoothing to forecast demand or the assumption that demand over consecutive time periods is i.i.d. is commonplace. In practice, these forecasting approaches are often invoked without justifying their appropriateness. In this paper we assert that, in many situations, the demand process may be different from that implicit in these commonly applied forecasting methods. In particular, we consider demand generated by a general ARM A process. For such a process, we derive expressions for the comparison of the steady-state sum of holding cost and stockout cost per unit time that results from using the correct forecasting model with that which results from the two commonly-used models mentioned above. This comparison indicates that correctly identifying the demand process is warranted and that popular efforts in batch-size reduction increase the benefits of doing so. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For many years difficult combinatorial problems, such as scheduling problems, have been solved by the practitioner with heuristics.

"This paper proposes a heuristic procedure to solve cyclical scheduling problems. Lot sizes for two or more items must be chosen simultaneously for several periods into the future, while recognizing capacity constraints at several work centres. Solving this problem is important in its own right. It also has transfer value to even more complicated situations, such as when the items have parent-component relationships. The proposed heuristic, though in the spirit of Mamie's formulation, has fewer production sequences for each item. The simplified formulation can be solved with a general linear programming code. Another advantage is its use of fixed ordering intervals, which seems to be preferred in practice. Experimental results suggest that the heuristic gives near optimal solutions and requires less computational time. Of particular interest is the heuristic's ability to satisfy capacity constraints when selecting item lot sizes. © 1984 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The flow of material during injection upsetting was studied to identify areas of the process which would require either, detailed definition or the use of simplifying assumptions, to enable the development of a complete mathematical model. Equipment for injecting El CM aluminium on to an upsetting platen and into a die-cavity, and a plane-strain equipment for injecting slabs of plasticene, were used to examine the characteristics of sliding in the injection chamber, of flow at the exit and of flow into the die-cavity. Considerations which are critical to the modelling of injection upsetting are the friction losses within the injection chamber, the presence of regimes of flow behaviour which are bounded by specific values of flange thickness and the identification of the extent of the transitional flow prior to the establishment of a steady-state distribution of shear surfaces. The accommodation of the strain-dependent behaviour of materials requires a fundamental description of strain within the upset flange. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The initial stage in the facilities design of cellular manufacturing systems involves the identification of part families and machine groups and forming cells possessing specific manufacturing capabilities. A new heuristic for the part family/machine group formation (PF/MGF) problem is presented in this paper. The distinguishing feature of this heuristic is its consideration of several practical criteria such as within-cell machine utilization, work load fractions, maximum number of machines that are assigned to a cell, and the percentage of operations of parts completed within a single cell. Computational results, based on several examples from the literature, show that this heuristic performs well with respect to more than one criteria. The heuristic also clarifies the source of various arguments in the literature concerning the ‘goodness’ of the solutions obtained by other researchers. An application of the heuristic to a large sample of industrial data involving 45 workcentres composed of 64 machines, and 305 parts is given, and the usefulness of the heuristic for trading-off several objectives is illustrated. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Through simulation experiments, we examine the performance of some maintenance policies in a group technology environment, in terms of some selected criteria. Three types of policies are employed: preventive maintenance (PM), for reducing the frequency of machine failures; equipment redundancy, for ameliorating the severity of failures, and composite policies combining PM and redundancy approaches. The results indicate that under the conditions assumed, equipment redundancy as a pure policy is ineffective, but coordinated PM policies tend to significantly counteract the ill effects of machine failures. Also, the performance of each composite strategy is largely dictated by its PM policy component.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six company types were identified within the engineering batch- manufacturing sector. These six company types have been used as the basis for assessing the effectiveness of production control systems in particular situations. The analyses, presented in this paper, show that the level of benefits expected from particular systems can be predicted, and that the order of sub- system implementation and the mode of operation will have considerable effect on the efficiency of a system. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper presents a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving an assembly line-balancing)ALB(problem with parallel workstations. Solutions represent a trade-off between the minimum number of stations required to achieve a balance and the cost of installing additional facilities. Both task costs and equipment costs are considered. A second feature of the algorithm is that it takes into account unproductive time during a cycle. The advantage of the DP approach is that it readily permits the recursive relationship associated with the serial ALB problem to be modified to accommodate the cost of paralleling. Solutions are obtained with an enumeration scheme that exploits known lower bounds. Two examples, and the results from a series of industry-based test problems, are presented to highlight the computations. In general, the algorithm performs well, but runs into trouble when the order strength of the underlying precedence graph is close to one or zero. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"An analysis of the process: Indentation of a cone into a semi-infinite material has until now only been made in cases of no friction between tool and specimen. By means of the axi-symmetric upper bound theory, it is shown how p/k can be determined for indentation into a prepared cavity with friction taken into consideration. Analysis has been made for the oone-angles 10°; 20°; 30°;, ⃛; 170°; 179·8°; and the friction factors 0; 0·2; 0·4;, ⃛ 1·0. The velocity fields and pjk values found, correspond well to those in earlier literature concerning the axi-symmetric slip-line theory. On the basis of the theoretical results, the friction factor causing change from Hill's to Prandtl's slipline field for the plane strain analogy is determined as a function of the semi-angle of the tool.

"Integrated material logistics is the integration of both materials and information flow into an effective and efficient total system. Continuous flow manufacturing (CFM) is a philosophy that concentrates on the elimination of waste, total quality control and total work-force involvement as a means of achieving and sustaining manufacturing competitiveness. This paper reports on the approach to the design and implementation of integrated material logistics with continuous flow manufacturing at IBM Havant Plant, The adoption of a competitive logistics strategy led to a fundamental re-appraisal of the role of logistics in discrete manufacturing. The later development and implementation of a blueprint required a focused cross-disciplinary team supported by more robust controls. Opportunities for work re-organization and devolution of responsibility were taken. With major investment in education and training, new processes and new measurements of process efficiency, a radical change in the culture of the facility was effected. The CFM paradigm continues to exert a profound influence for improvement throughout every aspect of the logistics process. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The paper describes the principles of load-oriented manufacturing control as a new solution for job shops and its successful implementation in a plastic leaves factory. The idea of load-oriented manufacturing control is to limit and balance work-in-process inventory on a level as low as possible in order to accomplish a high workcentre utilization as well as a rapid and in-time flow of orders. As the new system keeps actual lead times on a planned level in a self-regulating way it allows reliable due date scheduling. Furthermore, it points out the bottlenecks and performs applicable mid- and short-term capacity planning. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this paper we consider an n jobs one machine sequencing problem in which all jobs have a common due date and a deviation in its completion time occurs when a job is completed before or after the common due date. The objective is to find an optimal value of this common due date and a corresponding optimal sequence such that the mean absolute deviation of the completion times of the jobs in the optimal sequence from the corresponding optimal common due date is at its global minimum. Starting with an arbitrary sequence we relate the problem to a generalized linear goal program from which some basic results are proved using elementary properties of linear equations and a linear goal programming problem. Using these results and the idea of sensitivity analysis in linear programming, an algorithm is developed that determines the optimal due date and the corresponding optimal sequence yielding the global minimum value of the mean absolute deviation of the completion times of the jobs in the optimal sequence from the corresponding optimal common due date. In the end a numerical example to explain the algorithm is provided. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The theory of wire drawing is modified to allow calculation of a hydrodynamic film thickness and viscous friction coefficient using Reynolds's equation for the lubricant. Two cases, viz. (i) constant film thickness, (ii) exponential variation in film thickness, have been studied. The film thickness is determined by the principle of minimum rate of entropy production. It is shown that the apparent coefficient of friction varies significantly within the die. At small reductions there is an optimum die angle and under certain conditions there may be no optimum die angle.

"The paper studies a dynamical model of a manufacturing process taking into account: the purchase of raw materials; the scheduling of production; the planning of sales. We particularly deal with the planning of the production rate and of sales. The basic hypotheses are: the orders of each finished product are known over a given period of time T; the inventory levels are the state variables of the process; the control variables are the purchase, productiqn and sale rates. The goal of the ‘controller’ is to determine a policy which allows him to minimize at the time T the ‘capital’. As ‘capital’ we consider both the financial means and the technological resources employed in the process. Bilateral constraints in state and control variables have been introduced in our model. The Maximum Principle has been used to formulate the problem and to obtain a solution. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper defines optimum as the condition most favouring factors which influence certain objectives and the achievement of those objectives. Factors which may influence certain objectives can be classified as (a) alternate strategies, (b) states of nature, (c) time, (d) costs related to the achievement of the objectives. A suboptimum may occur as the result of one or more of the following actions. (1) Exclusion of one or more of the possible strategies (not based on economic consideration). (2) Exclusion of one or more of all states of nature (not based on economic consideration). (3) Inconsistency in the time intervals involved in the decision problem. (4) Neglect of the costs related to the achievement of the objectives. (5) Optimization of one objective resulting in a lower degree of attainment of other objectives.

"A number of operational situations exist in which certain facilities are available and where a number of commodities must be processed on some or all of these facilities. The paper describes an algorithm to generate schedules which are near optimal or optimal with respect to the total processing time of all the commodities, the idle lime of facilities and production rate. Thus, these schedules are characterized by near minimal or minimal total processing time and idle time of facilities and near maximal or maximal production rate. Usually this algorithm does not result in the desired schedule after the first application; it is therefore proposed to generate a set “D” of schedules from which the desired schedule can be selected. A decision rule determines the optimal number of elements belonging to set D. In order to justify the concept of the algorithm for the determination of the schedules mentioned above, an analysis is given of the decision tree associated with the sequencing model in terms of the probabilities related to the nodes in the decision tree. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1963,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Production management is concerned with the efficient transformation of inputs into desired outputs. Usually the operations are carried out under conditions of uncertain and fluctuating customers’ demand, varying procurement lead times for difference inputs, and the necessity to fix the production schedules long before the magnitude and the mix of the orders that must be filled from the resulting output can be determined. Under certain conditions it is possible to view production of this kind as a closed, self-regulating system which may be studied using some common techniques and procedures. In this paper we define such an operation in terms of several difference equations which describe the behaviour of a simple coupled production inventory system. It is shown that the coupling arises from the fact that the equations are both functionally and time-wise inter-dependent. A single equation of motion is developed to describe the dynamic behaviour of the system. Analysis ofthe equation shows that production and inventories are dynamically related. Furthermore: (a) neither the strength of control nor the time lag can be ignored; (b) as the time lag increases, the strength control must be reduced to provide the same level of stability; (c) a ‘quick responding system’ is not desirable when the system contains time lags; (d) production stability is enhanced by employing a target inventory level which does not vary, and by utilizing forecasts which are statistically unbiased and stable. © 1983 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis is extended to cover the effects of a single production station and a multi-station model, where rejects may occur at any station.

Moreover, it is noted that the sequencing issue of different board types in a production cycle is immaterial, given large machine capacity. Solution procedures for this components assignment problem are described and tested on data obtained from a real life industrial setting.

"Control of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is a complicated task due to the wealth of feasible alternatives. Such control is done hierarchically: in the cell level, part scheduling is considered; in lower levels the equipment control strategy is looked at. In building a knowledge-based control system the conditions and variables which affect the control mechanism have to be defined and represented in the knowledge base. Since the control mechanism defines conditions and actions in the environment, it is possible to reach conditions for which the action is not sufficiently defined, is not appropriate to control the system, or missing altogether. This paper presents two methods for knowledge-based scheduling, one for each level, and evaluates their ability to function under varying conditions that deviate from the expected ones for which the system was designed. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"For the purpose of analysing tube spinning, a model has been presented to describe both the energy necessary and the forces, as well as the process mechanism in detail, e.g. the distribution of strain and velocity, risks of fracture, etc. This paper deals with an attempt to formulate such a model for tube spinning. The model is formulated in plane strain. Shen considered from the point of view of a material element, the process is discontinuous and can be regarded as a series of successive fsorgings between a plane, infinite bottom tool and a top tool in the form of the profile of the roller. This model is dealt with theoretically by means of 18 series of slip-line fields. In order to test the slip-line fields under plane strain conditions, two types of model experiments are carried out: (1) forging of plastic wax with stress-strain relations analogous to the metals, (2) deformation of a so-called ' slip-line wax ', which after loading shows the picture of the slip-lines on its surface by means of colour changes. Both model methods have been developed during the last 5 years in our laboratory. Further tube spinning experiments have been carried out on a laboratory spinning lathe with aluminium as specimen material. On this basis correlations have been made between the plane two-dimensional model, which has been dealt with both theoretically and experimentally and the real metal forming processes. It has been proved that the plane model can be used successfully for evaluating three-dimensional tube spinning. The experiments also show that the process is not geometrically stable if reductions are above a certain value. If this is the case, the height of the ridges in front of the roller will continue to increase during the process. This can immediately be explained from the slip-line solution. In this way a useful tool has been created, facilitating the understanding of the complex processing mechanism of tube spinning and thus improving the process. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The work summarised in this paper has been directed to examine the basic requirements of warehouse layouts. Two simple types of layout have been examined and equations derived for the dimensioning of these, given such information as total volume of stock and number of stock lines. A sketch of the layouts is given. Ten factors have been considered in arriving at the theoretical layouts and it is shown that different types of layout are affected by different factors, some layouts being independent of factors to which others are sensitive. Dimensions of a layout can be calculated to minimise handling distance, handling time or space utilisation. Where cost functions are available for these parameters, total cost can also be minimised. The formulae lend themselves readily to computer manipulation, enabling an optimum layout to be determined given only the number of stock lines and volumes stored. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1968,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Exponential smoothing is one means of preparing short-term sales forecasts on a routine basis. To use exponential smoothing, however, one must decide the proper values for the smoothing constants in the forecasting model. One method for selecting the smoothing constants involves conducting a grid search to evaluate a wide range of possible values. An alternative method, called pattern search, is presented in this paper and is compared to the grid search procedure. Two criteria are used in comparing these procedures: (1) the standard deviation of the forecast error, and (2) the computing time necessary for a solution, The results of this comparison indicate that, when the exponential smoothing model includes trend and seasonal adjustments, pattern search requires far less computer time than the grid search procedure to produce smoothing constant values for which the forecast error values are comparable. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this study we analyse the behaviour of production levels and stocks in an integrally controlled multi-product multi-phase production system. We show that certain types of variations in the master production schedule (MPS) may lead to large short-term variations in production. To reduce the costs of these variations we introduce production smoothing, and we derive a modification of well-known integral production decision rules to realize smoothed production behaviour. By means of a small scale example we demonstrate the quantitative effects of our production smoothing rule on the variations in stocks and production levels. Finally, we present the general structure of a cost model that can be used to determine appropriate values for the smoothing parameters, given a specific production structure, a given capacity stmcture, and agiven variability of the MPS. We discuss various possibilities to arrive at these values. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A learning approach is presented to the design of comprehensive production control systems for complex situations. The approach essentially starts from the assumption that defining the production control problem and solving the problem are interdependent processes. Furthermore, the approach explicitly takes into account the fact that in complex situations, a priori knowledge about the problem situation is Beverly limited especially with respect to organizational circumstances. As a test, the approach has been applied to the problem of designing a production control system for a diffusion department of a semi-conductor plant. The different phases of the design process in practice are described and the results of each design phase are presented.

"The paper gives a practical, branch and bound based solution to the scheduling problem as found in real life. Organizational aspects of solving the scheduling problem are considered, and two organizational ideas, ’ the area of responsibility ’ and ’ the time span of action ’, are presented. Intelligibility to administrators and operatives of the output from any scheduling system is emphasized, and the adoption of a wholly new concept, the ’ Generalized Ordered Schedule ’, is advocated as a means of achieving intuitive appeal and improved control. The requirements which any useful scheduling system must satisfy are identified, from field Btudies, and reported. Data are presented on a collection of real problems, and comparisons of decision rule solution procedures with the branch and bound procedure given.

"Learning effects in the execution of repetitive tasks may often be adequately described by an exponential law commonly found in physical systems. This law is characterised by the rise time and the final value of output rate. An iterative method is developed for the determination of rise time and final value using only performance data recorded during early stages of learning, and is shown to predict these parameters sufficiently accurately for use in costing and in continuously updating lime standards. Further uses of the predictive technique include highlighting the need for increased supervision, or the replacement of particular operatives. When experimental data is oscillatory in nature, prediction errors are greatly reduced by three-point averaging tuned to the period of oscillation. Much of the experimental data has been recorded in industrial environments, frequently for long production runs. © 1970, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1970,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Process planning is the task of generating a plan for transforming raw material to its finished form according to design specifications. The existence of alternative feasible process plans for a part and the manufacture of several parts in a single facility sharing constrained resources, makes careful selection of process plans essential. This paper formalizes the selection of process plans with the objective of minimizing the total processing time and the total number of processing steps. The set of plans are then consolidated to minimize the resources used. This is accompanied by intangible benefits such as simplified planning and scheduling, fewer constraints on designing the layout, and an overall reduction in the manufacturing cost. As a word of caution, it may be added that process plans have wide ranging impact on factory operations and it is unrealistic to expect a single model to be comprehensive in addressing the problem. The model outlined in the paper highlights the key issues and provides an analytical basis for selecting process plans. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A range of ceramic materials has been developed at Lucas Syalon Ltd under the trade name of Syalon ceramics. Some properties of Syalon ceramics related to metal cutting are outlined, and a review isgiven of the machining tests carried out at the Department of Engineering, University of Warwick. The results indicate that the materials ranging from cast-iron to Jmioloy-901 can be machined with Syalon ceramics at speeds and feeds which previously were not achievable with any other tool material, in terms of productivity an increase of six to tenfold has been achieved in different cases. These materials can cut at speeds normally associated with ceramics, but because of their better impact strength approaching those of ceramic coated carbides they are also able to take heavier chip loads. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper deals with methods of measuring tool wear with the help of radioactivity. A technique which is safe, fast, free of human error and very versatile. Cyclotron-induced radioactivity technique can be used to irradiate the areas of the tool which on machining would wear. When the tool wears during the process of machining the residual activity is monitored by a solid state scintillation counter. This perhaps is one of the fastest methods to determine the tool wear and could be easily used for on the line monitoring. The technique has successfully been used for metal cutting operations such as turning, drilling and EDM, etc. © 1982 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The paper starts by introducing and discussing the results of wide-ranging field sudies carried out within manufacturing industry with the purpose of determining how accurately important engineering parameters with respect to processing materials are identified in practice. The results show exceptionally wide variations even in comparison with the recommended limits of a data bank. The paper infers the difficulties for proper assessment of advanced technology given that conventional technology is not yet adequately understood under operating conditions. For future development in technological research, the systems approach would appear to be more likely to produce applications orientated data and this would seem logical from the production engineer's viewpoint. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Experimental studies are described to show that high-frequency radio observations provide a simple way to monitor the E.D.M. process and to distinguish between the effective spark and arc discharges. The paper also describes how radio frequency emitted during machining could be used to optimize the E.D.M. process. It was found that radiation from the region of the gap between the electrode (tool) and the workpiece are significantly different when the following conditions occur: open voltage, sparking (effective machining), arcing and short circuit.

"In this note, we characterize the scope of the product form solution that has been presented in the paper, ‘A closed form solution for the G/Mandsol;r machine interference model’ (International Journal of Production Research, 1988, 26, 1811-1818). In this paper, the machine interference problem has been solved for JV heterogeneous machines that are ‘repaired’ by a set of r operatives, which repair the machines in a service-in-random-order fashion. The authors solve the model allowing for different, independent and identically distributed times between breakdowns for each machine and different negative-exponential repair times for each machine. In this short critique, we show that the solution presented by Bunday and Khorram does not solve the classical machine interference problem unless the hypothesis of heterogeneous machines is relaxed. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This paper concerns a study of the effects of using various priority scheduling rules for capacity management and shop floor control in an MRP production system. The results of the study show that the application of different priority rules does cause such a system to perform differently. The indications are that a practitioner could cause his MRP system to perform in a more desirable fashion by his choice of priority scheduling rules for shop floor control under various capacity levels. © 1985 Taylor and Francis Ltd.,1985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A mathematical model has been developed in this paper for treatment of multistage scheduling with stochastic lead times. The model accounts for the interdependence of successive stages and incorporates the expected costs of both early and late deliveries of raw materials at each stage. Total cost is then minimized through application of an iterative technique to determine optimum lead time for raw materials orders. The optimization procedure also results in the stage cycle times and start-up delays as a part of the minimum expected cost configuration. An example has been solved to illustrate the method. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both the sequence of point operations and the method of clamping have a strong impact on the total amount of time that is needed to complete each workpiece. In this paper we analyse the efficiency of two clamping methods in the production of automotive engine blocks. The efficiency of these clamping methods is measured in terms of time, which is minimized by determining the optimal sequence of operations required for each method of clamping.

"The purpose of this paper is to determine the cost effectiveness of recently proposed smgle-stage lot-sizing algorithms in multi-stage settings. Seven different algorithms and six combinations of methods were examined in conjunction with four cost modification procedures. These procedures attempt to account for the interdependencies across stages by altering the costs employed for decision- making purposes. A series of simulation experiments was conducted where the set-up cost, the product structure, and the demand distribution were varied. It is concluded that the combination methods when used with some of the cost modifications result in enhaoceil performance in comparison to other sequential approaches. © 1985 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This survey of the adoption of total quality control (TQC) in 98 companies in the Netherlands shows that few firms do set goals with respect to quality and quality control and that even fewer firms evaluate their own quality performance. The adoption of total quality control is a very time-consuming process, which may take about ten years. Furthermore the adoption process is often dominated by solving the quality problems by experts instead of improving the problem-solving capability of the organization. The adoption process of TQC and the actual application of TQC are related to each other and to company characteristics. In particular the size of the company is related to the formalization of the quality system. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper develops an analytical formula for throughput (jobs per hour) of a serial production line with variable processing times and limited buffer capacity. For a line with identical workstations in series, throughput can be accurately estimated by a simple function of four parameters: mean and standard deviation of processing times, number of stations, and buffer size. Extensions of the formula to account for differences between stations are also presented. The formula allows line performance to be assessed quickly and easily with minimal data, and is useful in initial production system design. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The scheduling literature has developed two almost mutually exclusive problems; a static and a dynamic scheduling problem. The result has been that different tools have been developed to solve each problem. In this research, a model is developed such that it contains elements of both the static and the dynamic problems. This model, called here the discrete release model, considers the routing, loading, and release decisions as well as the customary sequencing decision evident in most job shop research. The objective of the research is to implement a method for examining tentative loading assignments prior to their release to the shop floor. The research develops a single pass, sequential routing and loading system. A heuristic is then developed that will enable jobs to be reloaded and rerouted prior to their start of processing. The system is tested in various shop environments to ascertain the effectiveness of this loading heuristic. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper develops a heuristic procedure for generating feasible solutions for the single-machine, multi-product, infinite-horizon, lot scheduling problem. This problem occurs in several practical situations, for example, in metal stamping factories, on appliance assembly lines, in the beverage blending and bottling industries, in paint production and on motor car assembly lines. The proposed heuristic divides the N products into G groups and the products belonging to the same group are produced in the same cyclical pattern. Thus the problem of scheduling N independent products is reduced to that of scheduling G groups of products. Since G is much less than N, the problem is made simpler. The proposed heuristics has two main advantages: implementation facility and effectiveness. Computer codes are available for several mini and micro computers. The effectiveness is demonstrated by two tests. First, we solved the six problems originally solved by Elmaghraby (1978 a). Obviously, the results based on only six problems, cannot be generalized. Second, the G-group heuristic, as well as five other heuristics, was applied to 270 random computer-generated problems. The results show that it performed better. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Computer Aided Design systems are in common use particularly in the fields of architecture and engineering design, but such systems generally ignore an important component of man-machine systems, Man himself. However, all products, simple or complex, consumer or capital, involve human intervention in their manufacture, use, or maintenance. Human factors should be considered early in the design process, but this often proves to be time consuming or expensive by traditional methods.

"This paper introduces and tests a production planning procedure to be applied in a rolling horizon with probabilistic demands, based on the work of Bookbinder and Tan (1983). First, the case of no lead time for replenishment is considered and trend-seasonal demands are studied. We vary the set-up cost, order cycle and number of periods in the future for which demand forecasts are available. The procedure is compared to that of Silver (1978) in terms of cost performance, percentage of demand short/period and percentage of periods with stock-outs. Each approach appears to have merit. The proposed procedure generally yields a lower solution cost, while Silver's procedure usually has a Lower percentage of demand shortlperiod and a smaller percentage of periods with stockouts. Differences between the two procedures were relatively insensitive to which of three lot-sizing rules was employed within them.

"During 1978 a pilot study was carried out among a number of companies and institutes in North-Western Europe. The purpose was to determine by what ways, and means management know-how is being transferred from Western Europe to the Third World. The concept of management know-how was restricted to those aspects which are required to manage (a part of) an industrial enterprise or another organization in order to achieve (economic) results. Five areas of management know-how were distinguished management methods and techniques; internal and external social relationships; phases of management process; levels of management; functional management. In general, know-how consists of a combination of knowledge and skill. Know-how will only lead to useful results if it is applied with the right attitude and has been adapted properly to the specific culture and infra-structure. ‘Transfer and adaptation’ of management know-how should be regarded as a learning process in which two-way communication takes place. It is better therefore to speak of ‘exchange’ of management know-how. Management consultants and educators can play an important role. For proper management of change, a change of attitude and know-how of management is often required. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The simple EOQ lot sizing model or some variant of it is often used in discrete parts production lot sizing to obtain ballpark estimates of economic production quantities.

The system consists of (a) a forecasting procedure for market demand (b) a medium term control system for workforce planning (c) a. net requirements calculation procedure (d) a short-term control system for raw materials purchasing and production and distribution scheduling. These various sub-systems are combined into an integral system. In order to optimize and to evaluate the systems’ behaviour, an analysis was carried out and characteristic variables were described as functions of the control parameters. A procedure has been developed for the periodical, integral optimization of the control parameters to take into account changes in operating conditions.

"Performance obstacles are factors in the work environment that restrict productivity by inhibiting employees in the execution of task responsibilities. In spite of their apparent importance, little research has been done to describe, categorize, or assess these obstacles. A research project carried out in 12 United States electronics firms demonstrates that employees in two groups (circuit board assemblers and manufacturing engineers) view performance obstacles as having a significant influence on their performance. Materials and information obstacles emerged as being the most important to the circuit board assemblers. For the engineers, information and control/authority were the most important obstacle categories. Managers tended to agree with circuit board assemblers about the importance of obstacles for that employee group. However, managers tended to disagree with the engineers, giving lower ratings of importance than the engineers did in several categories. The research provides a step toward a typology of performance obstacles, demonstrating similarities and differences between employee groups and it suggests that at least in some areas managers may not be as accurate as they could be in assessing the influence of performance obstacles on their employees. The findings indicate that the themes that have prevailed in the research on operations management (i.e. materials, quality, scheduling) are viewed by employees as being predominant factors in the productivity equation. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Optimal replenishment rules are presented for determining both the best stock-up level and the best time to receive an order in a fixed order-interval inventory system subject to stochastic demand. In developing such rules, an important but so far neglected factor is taken explicitly into account, namely, the portion of the period during which demand cannot possibly occur. It is shown that replenishing the system at the right time is far more important than replenishing the system up to the right level. The findings have special importance for review of just-in-time policies which may inappropriately (in this context) suggest timing replenishment so as to coincide with commencement of demand. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper reviews the role of Production Activity Control (PAC) in modern production and inventory management systems. It argues that the PAC system is fundamental to the realisation of computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) at the operational or shop floor level. It presents an architecture for PAC and suggests that to date research has overemphasised one element of PAC, namely the scheduling function, and further has considered scheduling as an isolated problem without reference to the overall PAC system requirement. This, along with the tendency to consider scheduling as a combinatorial problem to be solved using mathematically elegant techniques accounts for the ‘theory-practice gap’ in scheduling. The paper concludes with some suggestions for further research effort in the PAC area. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The mean temperature of commercially pure aluminium slabs, upquenched in a heat treatment bath and (down) quenched in water, was determined theoretically and experimentally; analysis and experiment were found to be in close agreement. The same theoretical approach was then used to estimate the relative times for different specimens to absorb the same amounts of heat energy. The assumption that geometrically different specimens of the same degree of cold work require the same amount of specific heat energy input to effect recrystallization was made. Thence, with the aid of experimentally determined times for complete recrystallization of specimens of any given thickness, each with different amounts of prior cold work, the theory was employed to predict recrystallization times for Eipecimens of different thicknesses but with the same amounts of cold work. In this way, the times for recrystallization of any specimen, for given material and upquench and quench bath conditions, with any amount of cold work, were determined (given experimentally determined times for recrystallization of specimens at the various amounts of cold work). Again analysis and experiment were found to agree closely. © 1975, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1975,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A computer based system that plans and optimizes the manufacture of components on automated machines is presented. The input to the system consists of information regarding the machining operations that are to be performed in the manufacture of the component. Utilizing this information the system selects a member from the set of automated machines that can perform the operations. It then selects tooling based upon the machine parameters and raw material characteristics. The optimum technology parameters are determined based upon the criterion of minimum time of manufacture. Cost and time values are calculated for the particular machine under consideration. If more than one machine is available in the set of machines that can perform the work, the system repeats the process for each machine. The output from the system consists of optimum technology parameters, tooling, costs, times, etc. for each machine. Thus, the optimum machine can also be selected.

The bulk and volume distribution of the workpiece are found to have a significant effect on the thermal e.m.f, and hence on the tool wear rate in conventional metal cutting. The measurement of thermal e.m.f. in a practical environment is considered to be feasible since the requirement that either the tool or workpiece is insulated may be easily realized and the measurement is not affected by the presence of coolant. © 1982 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most procedures in materials management may be grouped into two classes: deterministic material requirements planning with bill of material explosion on the one hand, and usage-oriented stochastic inventory control models on the other. Each approach is also used for optional parts. With the first class of procedures, however, the random aspect of usage ratios is neglected, whereas in the second class of product structure, relations to planned final products are lost sight of. In the following paper, there is first developed a model of usage ratio generation which reveals the factors influencing the parameters of a usage ratio distribution. The model exhibits satisfactory agreement with practical observation. The paper then demonstrates how usage ratios may be included in a material requirements planning procedure despite their stochastic nature © 1983 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The analysis and conception of metal cutting given in the paper not only makes it possible to formulate the contents and qualify methods of acquiring knowledge in metal cutting with a higher degree of accuracy, but indicates at the same time a sort of entrance into cybernetics, of which the important aspects are: (a) mathematical description and modelling of the manufacturing process of metal cutting; (b) optimilization of the control of manufacturing processes of metal cutting; (c) solving the problems of optimal designs of manufacturing processes and machines; (d) mechanization and automation of information system. In view of the little attention paid in the branch of machining to the mathematical description of actions and operations, which has retarded the advance in the development of the theory and practice of machining, then cybernetical works on machining are likely to make great strides and find an extensive range of practical applications. © 1973 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"There is a widely accepted philosophy of production organization which has provided the foundation for the design of nearly all the world's factories. It is based on a set of beliefs which until recently were never questioned. This philosophy provides restraints which make it difficult to increase efficiency. It inevitably produces very complex, material flow systems, makes it difficult to delegate responsibility for the completion of products or components and leads to highly bureaucratic systems with centralized decision making and a low level of job satisfaction. Since the Industrial Revolution we have learned to plan the production of components with some precision. Until recently we did not plan material flow systems; they only evolved as the results of thousands of independent component planning decisions. We now know how to preplan simple and efficient flow systems and to achieve by this means major gains in both productivity and workers’ job satisfaction. © 1982 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Work structures and technical innovations which simultaneously mobilize the capabilities and skills of the individual employees to prevent dequalification make new demands on the qualification process. Training for more complex activities can therefore no longer be carried out using unsystematic forms of instruction consisting of demonstration and imitation Rather it is essential to apply systematic training methods aimed at the creation of a sensorimotor and cognitive regulatory basis. These processes not only mobilize thought and planned activity, but also have a positive effect on output. Training methods which promote personality are, however, ineffective as long as no corresponding work structures with freedom of activity are made available, which allow the opportunity for higher qualification—or at least stabilize the qualification level. But work structuring alone does not guarantee the subjective exploitation of new freedom of activity. Vocational training measures can contribute to freedom of activity being not only used, but also greatly promote development of the personality. © 1983 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"CAD systems and other planning instruments are used more and more in designing manual and partly automated work systems. Ergonomic aspects are often not taken into consideration because of a lack of usable ergonomic design instruments. On the other side, a planning system for the dimensional designing of movement facilities was developed and used with success in West Germany—the Video Somatography. In connecting the two different systems, a new integrated ergonomic system was created. Thereby workplaces can be planned and designed using ergonomic and technical criteria in an optimal way. Further advantages are expected by integrating ergonomic knowledge into the system.

"This paper solves the problem of calculating the efficiency of M groups of N machines under the care of one operative (robot), whose way of working is to patrol the groups either uni-directionally or bi-directionally, depending on whether they are located on a circle or on a line. Each group of machines is situated on a rotating circular disc (carousel). This work extends the work of Kim and Koenigsberg (1987) as well as the earlier work of Koenigsberg and Mamer (1982) and uses both of the models derived by Bunday and El-Badri (1984) and Bunday et al. (1985) for the uni-directional and the bi-directional patrolling problems. The problem arises in the practical context of a textile winding process and has some other industrial applications. Results are of value in maintaining controls and monitoring the process. A comparison of the two models considered in this paper can be made both numerically and graphically and, as has been shown before by Bunday and El-Badri (1985a, b), higher results for the efficiency, are obtained by patrolling uni-directionally rather than patrolling bi-directionally. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The run time of each machine is assumed to have a general distribution, different for each machine and the repair times are assumed to have a negative exponential distribution with different means for the different machines. An explicit expression for the probability that a particular group of machines is found running in the steady state is derived. From this other useful measures for the system can be obtained.

"Generations of managers in industry and of academics in universities, have been intrigued by the problem of how to plan, and more recently how to automate the scheduling of the operations needed to make parts, on the machines and other work centres in a factory. Today, with one possible exception (OPT) (Goldratt 1980), we are no nearer a reliable solution than we were 100 years ago. Early attempts at centralized operation scheduling, were based on Gantt charts or planning boards. Later solutions have used the computer. They all face the problems that with traditional forms of organization, there is a very large number of constraints which affect the solution, and that if a machine-breakdown, absent worker, material shortage or other disaster makes it necessary to change the schedule, it is generally impossible to revise it to suit the new situation quickly enough to keep the factory running. The usual solution is: ‘Tell the foreman to do the best he can’. This paper submits that the introduction of group technology (GT), coupled with period batch control (PBC), so simplifies the problem, that with minor analytical assistance the GT group foremen can do their own operation scheduling, more reliably and cheaply than it can be done by the computer. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The paper relates to a research project carried out in the Department of Building, UMIST in conjunction with the Building Research Station into the development of techniques for the measurement of dimensional inaccuracies of strong height precast concrete units up to 8 m long. This resulted in the design of new and inexpensive instrumentation based on that already commercially available, which was applied to determine the degree of deviation to be expected in the production of these units. Particular emphasis is given to the measurement of form deviation, or twist, and the problems concerned with its determination in the factory environment. The inherent dimensional inconsistencies resulting from the material used and manufacturing processes is briefly reviewed. The paper examines the validity of recognized metrological concepts in the context of the increasing emphasis upon prefabricated component assemblies as an integral part of the building process, and discusses the relationship between the requirements of accuracy control dictated by the assembly procedures on site and those likely to be achieved by the production processes in the factory. The problems of setting standards for tolerances in realistic terms are considered in the light of current practice in the detailing of this form of construction and are related to the production inaccuracies involved. © 1972 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Assembly line job sequencing establishes the order in which jobs are processed by an assembly line. This research focuses on job sequencing methods for assembly lines with work stations that receive the same fixed job sequence, are coupled together so that there is no work-in-process storage, and are balanced so that jobs move continuously between them at a constant rate. Automobile assembly lines frequently have these characteristics. Simple analytical principles are derived that aid in evaluating trade-offs between different job sequencing objectives. Included are set-up cost objectives related to operations performed on every job but in different choices (e.g. automobile painting) and capacity utilization objectives related to operations not performed on every job (e.g. installing vinyl roofs). These principles provide the basis for a job sequencing method that can be applied either by hand or with the help of a simple sorting routine. © 1987 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper describes the operation of assembly lines where items are rigidly attached to a moving conveyor bolt and where the processing stations are confined within fixed boundaries. Another mechanical method of product transfer, namely indexing, is also discussed, Both Monte Carlo simulation models and two industrial examples yield convincing evidence that for good flowline design the ratio of on-line inventory to stations should be greater than unity. Such a condition would effectively discriminate against the use of stochastic assembly line balancing techniques, although they have been developed specifically for such systems. In addition, the results confirm that the most economic way of operating these lines is to sot a pace that is fast enough to generate a small proportion of unfinished items. © 1978, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1978,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The practice of ignoring station length constraints on assembly lines where large items are attached to a moving belt at regular intervals and permitting neighbouring operators to perform their tasks within the same track sections to some extent is frequently observed in industry and has often been mooted in research publications. However, no theoretically or numerically derived results exist to demonstrate the effectiveness of such measures in alleviating the debilitating interaction of a constant, mechanically-set throughput rate and a series of work stages that each exhibit a random nature with regard to their operation times. Such considerations are important because capital investment in this type of manufacturing facility is usually high, output is also of high value and the assembly technology generally decrees that facilities are semi-permanent, and thereby emphasises pre-production planning aspects. The following paper employs a Monte Carlo simulation model to show that under certain circumstances the adverse consequences of mechanical transfer can be overcome and to present a generalized set of figures for output efficiency for use in estimating the potential of any such line design. Finally, this is discussed in relation to those methods previously advanced for setting optimal resource allocation and/or operational procedures on both planned and established fixed-item conveyor-paced assembly lines. © 1979, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The trials of coping with negative aspects of behaviour such as absenteeism, lateness, and lahour turnover have persuaded many companies to abandon the assembly line mode of mass production. Job enlargement exercises have demonstrated the benefits of assigning the building of a complete unit. to one operator, thereby eliminating the co-ordination problems associated with dependent stages, but unless accompanied hy a radical reappraisal of methods this may lead to a. large increase in standard assembly time per unit.

"A simulation, model has been developed to describe an assembly line where items are removed from a conveyor belt for processing and returned for transportation to subsequent work stations. Output characteristics are presented for the case where operator's work-time distributions can be approximated to a normal curve, and the analysis is made so as to generalize the results over a useful range of tolerance, feed interval and mean service times. In particular, the effect of buffer capacity on line performance, and its relevance to tolerance time, is studied. The work is extended to cover carousel-type systems and the case where items are moved on discrete load-bearing fixtures, e.g. hooks. Some interesting anomalies arise with respect to the hook-type conveyor belt arrangement. Hook-type flowlines differ markedly in their behaviour according to whether buffer capacity is provided or not. The nature of these operating characteristics is discussed in terms of the influence of tolerance time, buffer capacity, and hook density on the variable feed rate associated with such assembly lines. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Suppose the number of jobs which can be stored in front of the machines in a job shop is limited. As a result, arriving jobs for which there is no space in the shop will form a shop queue. The production capacity or maximum departure rate of jobs from the shop will depend on the way in which jobs are selected from the shop queue for release to the machine queues. For a job shop with two identical machines and random routing of jobs a number of release rules are compared. It is shown that the production capacity is increased when the number of jobs in the shop is kept less than the available storage space. Among release rules independent'of job processing times and number of operations the optimum release rule is shown, using dynamic programming, to be the idle machine rule, i.e. only release a job to the shop when a machine would otherwise be idle. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many production managers of flow-line systems, such as in the steel and metal processing industries, observe the high levels of in-process inventories. They feel that it should be possible to reduce these inventories; however, before doing so it is necessary for them to understand their function. Although the general rule that inventories exist because of imbalance in supply and demand at a point within the system is true, it is necessary to show more precisely how such an imbalance might arise in single-product systems due to variability in processing times at the stations, or interruptions in production due to breakdown and subsequent repair of stations. Quantitative results have been obtained which indicate how such factors as the number, location and capacity of inventory bank, affect the system production rate.

"This article deals with a stocking policy for a group of items, characterized by the fact that when one item is ordered at normal order cost a, other items of the group. when ordered simultaneously with the first, will only cost αa (&lt; 1). In this case, the optimal order quantity Qn, fixed for normal ordering can be reduced to Qn√ α (see eqn.(2)). A simultaneous order should be placed, when the on-hand stock of another item is under its normal order level plus Qn(l — √α) or, in other cases, when it is under normal order level + Nt2, where N is rate of consumption and t2 connected with the time interval between ‘ normal ’ ordors. The second method is preferable over the first one when t2≤(Qn/N) (1— √α). The maximum stock forwhich storage space has to be reserved is equal to, or smaller than, when ordering according to the ’ normal’ system. The benefit of this system, as compared with ordering items separately, may vary for most practical cases between 8% and 50% of the total relevant stock-keeping and replenishment cost, dependant on the characteristics of the items in the group. Brown (1907) discusses the same problem; but he calculates a fixed family cycle time, based on uniform consumption rates, placing orders at fixed intervals. The present study assumes that average rates of consumption can be predicted, but they may vary in a random way. The results of the Brown method are Order Quantities and Family Order spacing, whereas the method presented, gives Premature Order Levels, and Reduced Order Quantities for each item separately, based on minimum Replenishment and Storing Cost. © 1972 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",1972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Various of the planning problems in FMS are introduced and the impact of tooling considerations observed. The effect of tool variety, product variety and product s-milarity on the frequency of two types of tool change, due to product variety and due to tool wear, are identified. It is shown that when variety is great tooling availability constrains scheduling decisions. The problem area is illustrated with reference to an example FMS, for which it is shown that tool capacity constrains scheduling decisions. The possibility of developing some part launch sequence which would minimize the need for tool changes is considered but found ineffective. Dynamically selecting jobs from queues so as to minimize tool change is also found ineffective. A linear programming mode, due to Menon and O'Gradey (1984). is described, but found to require further evaluation. A tooling post-processor for a simulation model is presented which computes the number of tool changes in any work schedule. For the FMS considered it is found that the number of tool changes due to product variety is small compared to those due to tool wear.

"In turning on a centre lathe between running centres an axial force is necessary to hold the workpiece steady under the forces generated in removing the material. This force can generate substantial friction moments at the interfaces between the supporting centres and the workpiece which oppose bending out of the line of the centres.

A permissible roughness of a ground surface has been taken as a limiting value for fine grinding. The function-aim of optimization has been set as the relation of the specific metal removal rate and the specific thrust grinding force tending to its maximum value. Thereby maximum feasible productivity and the most favourable conditions of the grinding forces expressed as the minimum-thrust grinding force have been taken into consideration. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The formation of production part-families by the application of Group Technology opens the way for more efficient manufacture. One area for improvement is reduction in manufacturing set-up times. Particular opportunities exist for minimizing total set-up time for the part-family when the set-up times for parts in the family are dependent on which part has been made immediately previously. Where the production of an entire family is to be repeated sequentially, the problem is that of cyclic scheduling, and a solution can be sought by Travelling Salesman methods. Where only selected parts from a family are to be made, and the family not repeated, the problem is acyclic. In this paper, an efficient technique is presented for determining the optimum part sequence in such an acyclic case, and the technique is illustrated by a specific industrial scheduling example. © 1983 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The gamut of manufacturing automation and its ramifications in relation, to the strategic and operational issues can be appreciated only if the forces driving the system towards automation and their interrelationships are understood, Whether the automated technology is rigid (hard automation) or flexible; whether the control architecture for the system is interactive, passive, or intelligent; and whether the system is a direct evolution from a corresponding conventional (non-automated) system are some of the important considerations. A framework is required to relate the system parameters, leading to different configurations, with the strategic issues such as mix of configurations and path of evolution from one to another (or a mix) configuration, and operational issues such as a hierarchical (push) versus pull production control and the software logic support. Such a framework in terms of technological sophistication levels and control software sophistication levels is presented. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In an assembly system with a fixed number of workers, job enlargement leads to parallel lines. Job enlargement reduces absenteeism and turnovers, thereby increasing productivity. Job enlargement also reduces the number of repetitions per period reducing the learning effect and hence productivity. In an optimal job design, the loss of learning must be traded off with the reduction in absenteeism and turnovers. In this paper we show that an optimal job design exists with respect to the system response time and propose an analytical model to achieve such a design. Our experience with the model suggests that an optimal job design is most important when a new system is considered, and when significant learning takes place. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Determination of time of temperature rise in a cutting tool is of significance in machining of metals. It is particularly so in milling where the cutting is intermittent, thus allowing time for dissipation of heat between successive cuts. Many researches have been directed to this problem but their findings vary widely within the range of 0-2sec. to 20min. It would seem that this wide variation is due to the effect of the first revolution where the feed is, in effect, continuously increased. As a result of the research incorporated in this paper, the time of temperature rise was determined, eliminating the effect of the first revolution. It varied from 006sec. at a very high speed of 342ft./min. to 1.4sec. at 11.2 f.p.m. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1965,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Determination of temperature distribution on the face of the cutting tool is one of the vital problems of metal cutting. The solution of the problem is considered to be a significant step forward in studies in the field of machinability and metal cutting. Analytical solutions of this problem are available but these remain to be confirmed by foolproof experimental techniques. The work described in this paper and the data presented arc largely experimental, though not completely. Experimental data were obtained by using the work-tool thermocouple and tool thermocouple techniques together-supplementary to one another. This approach largely succeeded, though a gap remains and this, for the present, has been filled analytically. It is felt, however, that with improvements, as discussed in this paper, a solution based entirely on experimental data will be possible. It is shown that the maximum cutting tool temperature is not at the cutting edge but away from it. For a given condition of cutting the location of maximum temperature has been found to be between 0-015 in. to 0-031 in. away from the side cutting edge.

Then a hierarchical clustering method is applied based on a measure of association among pairs of machine cells. Clustering is terminated when all the surviving cells are non-intersecting or when a single group is formed.

"This paper presents a methodology of predicting the maximum possible out-of- roundness of the hole produced, in BTA deep hole machining, as a function of certain machining parameters. Based on the solutions of the stochastic differential equations representing the machine tool-workpiece system in BTA deep hole machining, and the true cutting tool motion, an index describing the upper bound of the roundness error is defined. A parametric analysis of the out-of-round ness index is carried out. This analysis points out that at a low length-to-diameter ratio of the cutting tool, the axial force is the predominant factor causing the tooltip deviation from the ideal motion, and that the radial and tangential forces are the major causes for the tool tip deviation at high length-to-diameter ratio of the cutting tool. The experimental measurement of out-of-roundness of the specimens under different machining conditions shows that the roundness error obtained lies within the zone described by the theoretical prediction. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper presents a comparison of the performance characteristics of titanium nitride (TiN) and zirconium nitride (ZrN) coatings on drills. The objective of this work was two-fold: to choose the best coating for machining tough materials tike Hasteloy; and to determine a method of predicting the wear of drills. A longer life of drills leads to increased productivity of drilling holes in certain components of environmental-control systems and fuel-control assemblies (in the aerospace industry) made of tough materials like Hasteloy. The comparison of the two coatings and tool wear was based on the measurement of static and dynamic forces and torques, power spectral density and acoustic-emission plots. The measurements were carried out using piezoelectric dynamometers and an acoustic-emission device. Upon analysis of the data, it was found that drills coated with TiN performed better than those coated with ZrN.

"This paper presents an analytical approach to describe the cutting forces in 1ST A deep hole machining processes in the time domain. The method takes into account the effect of different machining conditions. Since the cutting velocities employed in BTA deep hole machining process are relatively high, and since small chips are produced due to the presence of tool chip breakers, the analysis is developed on the basis of the thin shear plane model. The cutting velocity is a linear function of radius and the rake angle. Cutting is different in the two regions of the cutting tool, so the total cutting force acting on the cutting tool is determined by integrating the force on a small incremental thickness of the cutting tool. This approach, to predict the value of the cutting forces without resorting to any empirical techniques, clearly illustrates the effect of various system parameters on the machining process. The resultant force system on a new BTA cutting tool consists of an axial force and torque. But with the increase in the number of holes bored, not only does the cutting profile deteriorate, but the wear pads do too. The resultant force system will then consist of three force components and a torque, due to the fact that the forces are not balanced at the wear pads. Under such conditions, the cutting force equations derived in the latter half of the paper, coupled with the properties of the randomly varying component, can be used as the forcing function on the machine tool to evaluate not only the response but also the regions of stability and instability during the machining. © 1984 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper describes the development of a non-heuristic algorithm for solving group techology problems. The problem is first formulated as a bipartite graph, and then an expression for the upper limit to the number of groups is derived. Using this limit, a. non-hierarchical clustering method is adopted for grouping components into families and machines into cells. After diagonally correlating the groups, an ideal-seed method is used to improve the initial grouping. A quantitative criterion called grouping efficiency is then developed for comparing alternative solutions. The algorithm and the criterion are demonstrated through an example. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A prototype computer-aided process planning (CAPP) system, PWA_Planner (printed wiring assemblies planner), is presented. PWA_Planner is a rule based system for preparing assembly plans for the manufacture of PWAs via automatic component mounting machines, PWA_Planner uses a forward planning procedure, starts from a design blueprint and a bare printed wiring board (PWBrpar; components are mounted on the board until the completed PWA is reached. The final assembly plan includes a component assignment diagnostic file, a process plan, and automatic mounting machine program files. PWA_Planner utilizes a computer-aided design (CAD) representation of the PWA and automatic component mounting machine descriptions to prepare the assembly plans. The assembly plans eliminate interference between components and mounting heads, utilize preferred component mounting paths, and consider the order in which automatic mounting machines assemble the PWA. PWA_Planner is written in PROLOG. Board descriptions, parts information, blueprint description, and components specifications are represented as facts. The capabilities of automatic mounting machines, mounting sequence, and interference checking method are written as rules. A forward-chaining control logic is used. It can be used to provide feedback to PWA designers on the producibility of the design and to generate good assembly process plans.

"Computer-aided process planning is an important function in the integration of CAD and CAM. There are two approaches in computer-aided process planning— variant and generative. The generative is more suitable to CAD/CAM integration because it can synthesize a process plan. The success of developing a generative process planning system is dependent on the CAD interface and process capability analysis, The direct interface with CAD eliminates the tedious data preparation for a process planning system (i.e., it eliminates coding). The process capability analysis provides an information base for process and sequence selection. This paper presents a generative process planning system—TTPPS (Totally Integrated Process Planning System). TIPPS uses a boundary representation from a CAD database for a part. A user applies the crosshair cursor on a graphics terminal and a menu display to specify surfaces to be machined.

"Modern Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMSs) are implemented to accomplish highly efficient, automated, concurrent production of several part types. The loading problem is the portion of the short to medium term FMS planning problem concerned with allocating operations and tools to machines subject to machine time and tool slot capacity restrictions. It is assumed that the set of parts along with their production goals for the period are specified. Heuristics can be readily constructed for specific objectives, but the real world problem has multiple objectives. In this paper we compare the performance of six loading heuristics on three existing FMSs. The heuristics differ in the objectives explicitly considered and in the relative priority assigned to the objectives which are considered. Performance of the heuristics is based on separate evaluation of the five objectives: workload balance, volume of inter-machine part movement, routing flexibility, tool investment and maximum machine utilization. In general, performance on the criteria is seen to differ in accord with the heuristics' objectives. However, assigning operations to machine types based on workload balance performs better than assigning to the most efficient machine type. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facing competitive pressure from both domestic and foreign sources, today's manufacturers must strive to keep delivery promises and reduce inventory. This depends largely on a manufacturer's ability to predict job flowtimes reliably, hence allowing the assignment of accurate and attainable due-dates. An approximation method is presented to estimate the mean and standard deviation of job flowtimes in a dynamic job shop with assembly operations. The accuracy of the method for predicting the flowtimes of jobs with varying structural complexities is assessed through computer simulation. While in general it is more accurate for jobs with simpler structure, the simulation results indicate that, over a range of test conditions, the approximation method is both simple and effective for estimating job flowtimes in assembly shops. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper studies the effect of uncertainty on capacity planning in MRP. Two sources of uncertainty are inherent in any capacity planning: (1) fluctuation in product demand and (2) variation in operation work contents. Through the use of computer simulation, experiments are performed on actual operating data supplied by an electronic8 company. It is found that the accuracy of a capacity plan is approximately a quadratic function of the level of variation in operation work contents and is significantly affected by product demand fluctuation. Theoretical treatment of the data yields the same conclusion, thus suggesting the validity of the simulation results. In view of these findings, the management is advised to exercise close control on the sources of variation so that acceptable accuracy can be achieved in determining a feasible production schedule. © 1987 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Learning curves and progress functions are well established management tools used to predict productivity in the start-up of new product lines, and to describe the performance of individual employees. As the authors, amongst others, have shown, these tools have been successfully applied to a wide range of tasks in highly varied industries. It is particularly useful, especially for inter-firm comparisons to compress the learning curves and progress functions into simple mathematical models in which the parameters may be determined by least squares error curve fitting or other convenient techniques. When on-line prediction is required, a digital computer algorithm is used to estimate the model parameters. It is essential that the parameter estimation technique used is robust in the presence of large amounts of scatter in the raw data. Particular problems arises in task in which the human operator is subject to job rotation, job re-design, or has to perform a variety of similar, but not identical tasks during batch production. Previous experience can therefore be regarded as prior practice in skill acquisition and it is important for management to determine the appropriate starting point on the new learning curve. Little has so far been published on this important topic. This paper will review the present state-of-the-art and show that in certain circumstances prior practice may he accounted for by relatively simple modification to learning curve.

In this particular process being studied the modelling of average performance has been carried out following established procedures.The variability of measured operator performance has been analysed in stages. Selection of the change points between stages has been based on increases in the monitored residual mean square value of the curve fits of the time constant model. Examples quoted include increases in variability due to changes in equipment, layout, personnel and work order load. Variability between groups has been discussed and two specific areas requiring future investigation have been highlighted. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a previous paper the author has studied some properties of the minimum cost control schemes using np-charts. The process model involves nine independent data parameters whose values have to be estimated before an optimum np-chart can be determined. Since errors in estimation often occur in practice, the present paper investigates the extent to which these errors affect the optimality of the control procedure. Four parameters are found to have negligible effect, three to have moderate effect, and two to have critical effect. Rased on these results, a discussion is presented on the practicality of the economic approach. © 1977, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A two-stage procedure for the design of a cellular manufacturing system is proposed. The first stage forms the part families. The use of clustering techniques with a new proximity measure is advocated for this stage. The proximity measure uses the manufacturing operations and the operations' sequences. The second stage forms the machine cells. An integer programming model is proposed for this stage. The solution of this model will specify the type and the number of machines in each cell and the assignment of the part families to the cells. The relevance of this approach in the design of flexible manufacturing systems is discussed. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.,1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper presents three approaches to minimize and eliminate scrap from stamping a single shape arranged in a single row or double rows on strip raw materials. In the first approach, interlocking shapes are generated. Although such shapes are scrap-free, they require congruent lines in the design. At the early stages of the design process, a skilful designer can compromise between functional features and symmetric features to improve nesting. The second approach is to characterize a shape by parallel lines bounding it. Specifically, the method to find a minimum area parallelogram that encloses a given convex shape is discussed. The result gives the optimum arrangement of a convex shape in single row. The third approach involves the nesting of a given shape in a specified pattern. Three computational algorithms for the single and double row arrangements are given. The double row arrangement includes a half-turn or a mirror reflection. The three approaches are all based on the concept of interlocking shapes and they can readily be implemented on a small computer. Depending on the design environment and the piece shape, one of the approaches can be used. © 1979 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Job assignment is a well-known problem in manufacturing lines. Line management tries to maximize line productivity by assigning a given crew a set of predefined line jobs. However, problems may arise because of abnormal conditions such as absenteeism, workstation failure, parts shortage, or unevenly distributed work-in-process. This report considers a dynamic job-assignment policy making use of online information for assignment. This policy attempts to achieve a good skill match between jobs and operators, and to eliminate unnecessary assignments. To fulfill this policy, a two-part assignment program is proposed: an algorithm for job matching and a set of ad hoc rules. The matching algorithm is well established in literature, but the ad hoc rules are application-dependent. Discussion here concentrates on the ad hoc rules and online data collection. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parameters of the tandem queues are derived from what we have learned from real production environments. Experimental results are used to construct statistical models by the least-squares method for the throughput and the coefficient of the variation of interdeparture times. When these models are employed recursively, the throughput of a sequential line can be evaluated. Compared to simulation results, error within 5% can be expected from this technique.

"Recent progress in manufacturing systems research has identified the feature of forbidding early shipment (FES) of orders as a prevalent characteristic of real systems. This report examines the implications of this feature on the choice of scheduling rules within a job shop. Simulation results of a simplified job shop reconfirm the superiority of the modified due date approach when the criterion is mean job tardiness. However, when the criterion is system inventory, the slack time per remaining operation ratio approach performs slightly better than modified due date. The shortest operation processing time yields very poor results in job shops that include the FES assumption. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to our test, bond energy analysis outperforms the other two methods, regardless of which measure or data set is used. If exceptional elements exist in the data set, the BEA algorithm also produces better results than the other two methods without any additional processing.

"A simple procedure for selecting the optimal economic design of an X¯ control chart for a single assignable cause system is presented that can be applied at the workshop level. The procedure only consists of solving an explicit equation for h (sampling interval) in terms of n (sample size) and k (control limit factor).

"The purpose of this paper is to report on research conducted to develop a simulation model which incorporates the basic MRP logic into the modelled production process. The objective of the modelling effort is to provide information necessary for planning and controlling of the material and capacity requirements of a production process that includes stochastic processes. The modelling and analysis procedure exploits the fact that the structure of the production process can be logically modelled as a network flow process. The technique employed to facilitate the network modelling is Q-GERT (Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique) modelling and simulation language. A case application is presented to demonstrate a prototype model, followed by a report of the simulation results. The model is designed to provide answers and insights to the following questions: (1) how long must each production centre operate to yield the specified quantities of finished products, (2) what is the expected lead time required to complete the production of finished products, (3) what are the utilization rates for various processing stations, and/or percentage idle times due to lack of preprocess inventories, and (4) where do bottlenecks occur in the production process, as evidenced by large queues of materials or subassemblies prior to the machine centres. © 1982 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This paper describes an approach to the optimization of heuristic scheduling in batch and jobbing manufacture. The approach is based upon the use of a composite weighted priority index to resolve conflicts between operations in order to meet a predefined management objective function. The effects of combined despatching parameters in the priority index are investigated and examples are given of the resulting response surfaces. Using the techniques of harmonic analysis a model of the underlying surface trend is identified and used to predict the location of optimal schedules. Typical experimental results are presented which suggest that the proposed method compares favourably with traditional scheduling techniques. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Ltd.,1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Following a short historical introduction the problems encountered in the control of different types of industrial processes are compared. Processes are divided into batch processes, continuous processes operating in steady state for long periods and quasi-batch processes, in which the control, when going from one steady state to another, is important. The modelling and development of control strategies for a narrow, hot-steel-strip rolling mill are discussed in detail by way of illustration and it is demonstrated how an iterative procedure can be used with ‘ feedforward ’ to give a near optimal control, advantage being taken of the inevitable time-delays that occur between stands.

"Regression techniques provide the cost analyst with a valuable analytical tool. This paper describes means of expanding the utility of regression analysis applications in this area. Part I of the paper presented basic definitions and developed measures to assess the accuracy and sensitivity of a regression formula. In particular, it was shown that the Association index, rather than the more commonly used R1, is the pertinent measure of formula sensitivity. We also described several other aspects of evaluating formula reliability—the confidence level, variability in the data, parameter stability, autocorrelation—and discussed indexes especially developed to quantify these factors. Part II deals with the application of regression techniques to such areas as shop machining costs and long-term overhead relationships. The selection of variables and observations for a model, and the use of non-linear regressions, are discussed. Several examples from aerospace, ship construction, and other manufacturing industries illustrate the discussion of complex non-linear formulae which includes several situations characterized by cost-improvement curves. The overall reasonableness of a formula is then discussed in terms of data comparability, statistical adequacy, operational relevance, and prediction potential, and the paper concludes with further comments on intercorrelation of variables. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Statistical method, and in particular, simulation is the most widely used operations research modelling approach now employed by industry and government. Validation of a simulation model is the procedure designed to determine whether the model is an accurate representation of the portion of reality under consideration. It is a process distinct from modelbuilding or debugging (although interrelated). In this work, strategies and practical numerical techniques for validating large-scale production simulation models (or any other arge system) are detailed. An evolution of the central concepts of large-scale model validation is represented first. The distinction between model user's risk and model builder's risk is highlighted as an important development which alters the problem into a consideration of the basis a decision-maker should use in determining whether to rely on the outputs of such models.

"Computer time-sharing is having a powerful effect on managerial decision-making in the cost analysis and estimating area, through the easy availability of multiple regression analysis. Unfortunately, the regression technique is still obscured by factitious technicalities, while the very nature of cost problems limits the value of conventional statistical techniques in evaluating the usefulness of an analysis. This article attempts to clarify the situation through a review of selected cases in which regression is used, and by suggesting evaluation techniques developed during extensive applications. Serious inadequacies in standard regression calculations and computer programmes are pointed out, new measures of formula adequacy are described and we conclude with a discussion of the criteria by which a cost formula may be judged to be ' reasonable '. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Classical models dealing with inventory systems usually assume, among other things, that the unit (or ‘piece’) cost remains constant over some given range and also that maximum profitability of the system is assured if cost minimization takes place. However, for operations which in themselves are not predominantly machine controlled but are essentially dependent on human skill, these assumptions may not always be valid since the performance of the operator will be subject to a learning process. This has the effect of decreasing the unit production cost including additional effects of rising incentive payments.

"The scheduling system described in this paper is to be used for the short-term planning and control of assembly systems at the production activity control (PAC) level. PAC operates as close to real-time as possible, and therefore the scheduling system has to be capable of analysing the manufacturing system and generating a schedule in a short time frame. Because of this time constraint, traditional scheduling techniques such as branch and bound, dynamic programming, etc., are inappropriate The approach taken in this scheduling system is to combine heuristic rules with newly developed artificial intelligence (AI) techniques while incorporating insights into scheduling gained from a study of the just-in-time, optimized production technology and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) approaches to production management.

"The paper suggests that the factors which limit the development and use of work measurement and work design in practice are those features of the organization which cause distortion of the measurements and restrict the application of the results.

"The forces that occur between a single grain and a workpiece during the cutting process have been measured by two methods. In one, a dynamometer which utilizes piezoelectric elements measures both the tangential and normal components of force, a small workpiece on the dynamometer being subjected to single grain cutting. In the other method, a single abrasive grain is mounted on a rotating member, the change of angular speed of which is measured during the cutting process. This speed change can be related to the average tangential force between the abrasive grain and the workpiece during the cutting process, although, in the present work, it is used directly to find the work of cutting. To determine the response of the dynamometer, and to calibrate it, small steel balls have been bounced off the workpiece, and the output of the dynamometer compared with the pulse shape that has been determined analytically. Included are oscilloscope traces showing the response of the dynamometer during the bouncing bait calibration, and during cutting.

"One of the resource utilization problems is the location of two-dimensional patterns onto stock sheets with finite dimensions. Stock sheets, in this respect, are depletable resources to be used and the remaining material which is known as the scrap (or trim loss) cannot usually be used later for allocating patterns. Thus, a decrease in the amount of scrap yields a decrease in the raw material cost. In the solution of the problem, usually templates of the patterns to be cut are placed on a stock sheet and then moved until an arrangement is obtained that appears to yield a minimum amount of scrap. Presently, this type of manual solution procedure is used and the algorithms are terminated intuitively when the solution obtained is usually far from the optimum.On the other hand, mathematical programming techniques are generally inadequate for the solution of these problems due to computational burden. Hence, the use of heuristics becomes more appropriate. In this study, a heuristic approach is proposed and the associated software is developed which uses various priority rules of allocation depending on the shapes of patterns. The proposed heuristic approach is then tested through data of some metal-cutting industries and satisfactory results are obtained. © 1987 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper describes a model sequencing algorithm for model-mix assembly lines. A new formulation of the sequencing problem is proposed, the objective function of which is to minimize the overall assembly line-length for no operator interference.

A complete factorial experiment was made on five factors to determine their influence on the overall assembly line length. These are, the number of models, the model cycle time deviation, the production demand deviation for each model, the operator time deviation, and the number of stations in the assembly line.

At the end of 72 minutes demonstration and practice session, all the operators were able to perform the assigned drilling task by employing the prescribed motions and came close to reaching the measured production standard. The average quantity and quality output increased from the first to the fourth quarter (15-minute) by 25 and 37%, respectively. Statistically the improvement was highly significant. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The objective of the present investigation is to find out the effect of various paces and operations on the rating error, after the subjects are trained by the programmed learning method (developed by the author) and conventional method of training performance rating. The experimental data were treated with statistical quality control techniques and it was found that both paces and operations had an effect on the rating error, irrespective of the training method. However, the rating error was less pronounced for the subjects trained by the programmed learning method compared to the subjects trained by the conventional method. Unfamiliar or complex operations caused rating errors of greater magnitude. Slow paces resulted in loose ratings, whereas fast paces resulted in tight ratings. It was observed that as the pace deviates from the middle range in the rating scale to the extreme ends, the rating errors get larger. Comparatively, errors of greater magnitude were noted at slow paces than at fast paces. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1964,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although a great deal of research has been carried out in the field of job scheduling this has generally been directed towards examining the benefits of particular rules and presenting improved algorithms. This paper examines how real job shop problems can be modelled and available scheduling rules examined for particular capacity loading conditions. A model of a medium-size production job shop is developed and it is shown that, for their particular shop layout and job mix, the performance and ranking of particular rules with respect to certain criteria, change with shop conditions. The mode! developed can easily be applied to a wide range of job shop situations and once performance charts have been produced for those scheduling rules available, they can be used to aid the existing scheduling system whether manual or computer based. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The non-linear integer programming model is based on a specific cell design procedure that considers two important aspects, such as robot selection, and cell configuration, in forming the assembly cell. The model incorporates stochastic variations in the batch arrival rate, batch size, and processing times. The solution procedure for the model is discussed and an example problem is used to demonstrate the use of the model for real world applications. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"When lack of control is detected on a control chart, the usual recommendation is to ‘search for an assignable cause’, or ‘take remedial action’, etc., without specific advice on how to proceed. One important situation is a continuously adjustable machine whose mean output is being monitored by a Shewhart -chart. When lack of control is indicated by a signal from this or some other type of control chart, a natural action is to make an adjustment to re-centre the process mean. In this paper we propose three simple methods for determining the amount of adjustment and report on analytical investigations of their properties Somewhat different from other literature in this area is our desire to avoid overadjustment of the process mean, viewing this as a more serious error than underadjustment. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Western society is well embarked on the transition from the industrial to the post-industrial era, The structures of the industrial organization, in particular, are growing increasingly dysfunctional because they stand at the confluence of changes involving technology, social values, the economic environment, organizational design, job design and the practices of management. Unless their managers can adapt, these industries will be the first to be hit by crisis and massive dislocation. However, theoretical and practical studios in ‘ socio-tochnical systems ’ under way in England. Norway and the United States during the last 20 years, suggest ways in which production organizations can fit themselves to the new characteristics inherent in the post-industrial field. In such a modified environment, jobs will be characterized by greater autonomy, adaptability, variety and participation. In return, workers will offer a higher degree of commitment to the job and the organization. Several examples and case studies are cited to support and illustrate the socio-technical approach to organizational design. © 1971, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A computer simulation of an assembly line enforcing pacing on manned sequential stations indicates that unpaced station operations are superior to paced. Using the variability and work-time distribution of operator performance on repetitive tasks, a number of studies were carried out which show that an assembly line cannot perform at maximum efficiency (in terms of operator idle time and units completed) unless queues are provided before each work station. Studies of various station speed configurations indicate that the generally preferred configuration is Fast-Medium-Slow (short-medium-long cycle time) and that there is little difference among various configurations when the inter-arrival time is larger than any of the operator mean cycle times. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1965,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Numerous experiments in job enlargement, direct worker participation and autonomous workgroups have been reported. However, little cumulative knowledge has been gained through a lack of conceptual and theoretical bases. Moreover, worker autonomy and technology, the major variables in those experiments either were measured by questioning workers and supervisors and are consequently modified by their perception, or were measured in a very broad fashion. In the present work more objective and specific measures for technology and autonomy, which can link job design research and experiments with job design practice, were developed and validated. Automony and technology are of course multidimensional concepts. Relevant aspects for job design are derived from a model for task related decision making which shows that the degree of worker autonomy is contingent on task technology and worker characteristics. Technology is measured by cycle time, task repetitiveness, task skill level, disturbance level of a task and the disruption potential of a task system, through observation. A distinction is made between autonomy in regulation, which keeps the process on target by counteracting disturbances and autonomy in control which specifies targets. Measures for both types of autonomy are developed. The measures of technology and autonomy were tested in a sample consisting of 411 work stations in industry and proved to be effective and efficient for job design purposes. © 1979, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"By means of a number of general models the relationships are analysed which are of importance when applying shiftwork systems: for the organization which applies them, its employees, the owners and the community. A quantitative model gives an insight into the shiftwork system which can be regarded as an optimum from an economic angle (depending on the pay level, shift allowances and invested capital). Divergences from the optimum may decrease the rate of return considerably. The outcomes of an analysis of alternatives in a series of companies axe discussed. The approach on the side of companies frequently proves not to be satisfactory.

"In this paper we derive approximations for the main performance characteristics of balanced flowlines, i.e. flowlines with identical workstations and equally-sized intermediate buffers. The derivation of the approximations is based on a hybrid approach: classical results from queueing theory are mixed with empirical findings. The approximations are extremely simple to compute regardless of the dimensions of the Bowline. The form of the approximations hint at possibly existing structural results for balanced flowlines that call for further more fundamental research. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Selective assembly is used whenever the tolerances which have to be allowed for the components are so large that the natural build up with random assembly will not satisfy functional requirement's. The traditional method divides the more variable components into a number of zones of equal width and then specifies what combinations of grades may be assembled so as to produce sufficient uniformity in the final product Theoretically there is no limit to the number of grades which can be used, but there is a serious organisational problem of having only the specified categories available at one time, and another control problem to ensure that components are correctly graded. Further, a large proportion of components may not be usable through.mismatching of quantities and this can increase costs considerably. These difficulties can be reduced by suitable quality control schemes which are additional to the grading operation The method proposed in this paper is that components should be balanced by quantities rather than by size. It depends upon knowledge of all process capabilities and requires a quality control scheme to ensure that the mean size produced for every component coincides with the objective mean. The grading operation itself gives rise to a simple quality control scheme which is based on the balancing quantities. The same scheme is applicable to all components. Mismatching is impossible as long as control is maintained and all components are used in a reasonable period of time It is shown that many applications can be made with only three grades and that even extreme sized components can be used. Methods are given to compute the variation which will be obtained from product to product when selective assembly is only applied to some types of component and the remainder are assembled at random. Thus, it is possible to design a procedure which will give sufficient uniformity at minimum cost and avoid the complexity of excessive numbers of categories. Errors in following this simple procedure will be less than those incurred with more traditional methods The extension of the method to a larger number of grades is explained and the whole is illustrated by a case study of the assembly of a selector bank used in automatic telephone exchange equipment. This is also used to show the importance of relating performance of the product to the dimensions of the components. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1961,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In laboratory experiments on the rapid partial annealing of cold-worked mild steel sheet, the experimental results have been used to derive an empirical model, interrelating the mechanical properties of the sheet with different variables selected in order of their effects on the particular mechnaical property. The validity of these process model relationships was tested by predicting the mechanical properties coreesponding to each of the experimental conditions included in the model and comparing them with the actual experimental values. This comparison revealed that only the 0-2% P.S. and the T.S. equations satisfactorily predict properties to an acceptable degree of accuracy. The scope and limitation of this type of empirical model are discussed in terms of application and the difficulties associated with precisely defining the pertinent process or material variables. Finally, it is demonstrated how the equations can be used to optimize the different process variables to achieve a given property level or combination of properties. © 1977, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Unlike most of the previous studies of the multiproduct, multimachine systems, hero an attempt is made to consider the man-machine overtime and idleness costs together with the usual inventory-related costs (the set-up costs, carrying costs, and back-logging costs). The major assumptions of the model include: (a) demand for each product is captive and constant; (b) single or multiple facility work centres may be employed: (c) the total manufacturing operations of any single product must be completed before another product can be started; (d) all the manufacturing facilities are set up simultaneously for each of the products and its production can be started only after all the machines are ready. The annual total variable cost function is found to be very complex. Therefore, a recursive algorithm is required to solve this function for the values of optimal produetion-cycle-thnes of the individual products, Tj*, s. As the facilities are assumed to produce only one product at a time, these cycle time values need to be fitted into a production schedule so that there is no conflict between any two products on any of the machines and so that any modification in the values of Tj*, s result in the least increase of the system's total annual variable costs. Such total annual variable costs, computed with the help of this model and its alogrithm for 15 different situations, are compared with those provided by two other known models. Each time this model performs significantly better than the other two. © 1978, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",1978,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A specially constructed simulated assembly task was used to test the effectiveness of several multichannel communication combinations. The assembly task was a pegboard with a 4 × 4 matrix of ⅓-in. diameter, 3 in. long wooden dowels placed on ⅓-in. centres. Three type3 of wooden washers were made to fit on to the matrix of wooden pegs. The washers were assembled on to the pegs according to a sot of instructions presented to the subject. The three primary communication modes under study were the verbal mode, pictorial mode, and the written mode. Instructions for the verbal mode were presented via a, prerecorded taped message. The pictorial instructions consisted of the presentation of n 35 mm coloured slide of the assembly task to be completed. The written instructions were also 35 mm slides, but of a typewritten message. The three primary modes were combined to form a series of multichannel mossagos, that is, information presented via two channels. Two groups of 90 subjects each, 90 industrial subjects and 90 university students, performed the assembly task. The hypothesis under investigation was that cue summation provides an initial insight into the explanation of multichannel communication. The specific hypothesis was that when multichannel cues summate there will be facilitation in performance. Also, the effects of interference and redundancy were investigated. The primary results were that the cue summation principle docs not seem to present adequate depth to form a basis for a theory of multichannel communication: however, in the absence of a ba3ic theory the pictorial channel still seems to be the most efficient communication medium for industrial procedure instructions. © 1971 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The introduction of flexible automated machine tools changes some of the characteristics of the production system in component manufacturing shops. Not only are machines made more universal by the use of flexible production automation, but it also is becoming more and more possible to change the set up of a machine without loss of productive hours. However, because of a limitation in the number of (often expensive) fixtures available per type of fixture, work orders are often finished more or less simultaneously, rather than in a sequential manner. This paper considers the logistic implications of these changes. In particular, the consequences of the quasi-simultaneous finishing of work orders for the throughput time will be analyzed. The paper shows that the work order lot size is a major factor in the determination of the throughput time per work order. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper gives the results of computations, for a chosen production control model, yielding the extra costs incurred when information about a change in mean demand level becomes available at some time relative to the time of the change. These extra costs are zero if the information is available from prehistoric times and increase monotomcally as the detection moment shifts to later points of time. Only “jumplike”changes of mean demand level are considered. It is found that the extra costs as a function of the detection moment N approach a linear asymptote for high N.

It was found that, in addition to providing a teaching method fitted to the apprentice's needs, the system (when in operation for the ninety-day pre-apprenticeship period) also allowed an instructor to give much more time to personal tuition of individual apprentices.

"Any study of labour allocation must take into account the fact that the industria structure of the economy is bound to change over time and that, this will put pressure on each kind of labour to redistribute itself continuously. Differing rates of labour-saving technical progress will have the same effect. Since labour is hardly perfectly mobile, this implies that its allocation should be regarded as essentially a disequilibrium process and that dynamic criteria should replace the usual comparative static criteria of efficiency. The purpose of this paper is to outline such a treatment. The analysis has deliberately been conducted at a relatively high level of abstraction because even a simple theoretical framework seemed to be lacking. The most important empirical feature that needs to be supplied is of course the labour mobility function. It may well be found that neither of the two cases distinguished in the paper corresponds satisfactorily to what is actually observed. Two well-known studies by Reddaway (1959) and de Wolff (1965) go so far as to suggest that firms may in practice increase or reduce their labour forces without altering their wage rates from the prevailing market levels. Whether such behaviour is optimal or not cannot be determined without bringing detailed institutional evidence to bear, but it does at any rate point, to the possibility that the mobility function may be shifted upwards or downwards according to whether the firm is active or passive in, its recruitment of labour. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper describes a production control plan which may be -used in a shop whose product line consists of numerous items which vary extensively in their demand pattern. The plan is capable of: (a) stabilizing production by allowing inventories to fluctuate with moderate demand fluctuations; (b) minimizing inventories of finished goods while providing protection against serious Btockout; (c) detecting significant changes in demand patterns and revising production schedules accordingly; and (d) scheduling production economically. Employing several well-known concepts, such as the control limits principle used in quality control, the plan considers simultaneously forecasted demand, forecast error, inventory position and shop capacity to arrive at production decisions. For this purpose, control limits are applied to both demand and inventory, and production is stabilized with a simple production smoothing procedure. Simulation results, based on data taken from a medium size production shop, demonstrate the plan effectiveness.

"This paper finds an optimal control policy for a production process that shifts randomly, but with drift, during production. The cost of deviation from the optimal setting is quadratic, and possibly asymmetric. The process may be reset at a fixed cost. Two models where the process drifts by discrete steps are explored and optimized. Use of these models to approximate continuous process shifts is discussed. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Most current data on manual handling performance are in the form of single-factor studies using the criterion of maximum weight liftable and measuring its variation with experimental conditions. This does not always help the manager attempting to set safe handling limits as his/her application will involve many of the factors. A recent paper by Drury and Pfeil showed how the task-factors of height of lift and awkwardness of object could be combined with the age and sex of the materials handler to predict performance. This paper is an extension of these methods to incorporate more data on the effects of lifting height, introduce a more general measure of awkwardness and modify the model to cover extended periods of lifting rather than a single maximum exertion. It is shown that the criterion of duration of lifting at constant weight leads to the same results as the criterion of maximum weight lifted. Other findings are that the height of the object at both the beginning and the end of the lift are required to specify performance, and that carrying performance can be treated as an extension of static lifting performance. © 1975, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1975,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite the numerous studies on human lifting ability no Berious attempt has been made to devise an empirical prediction model based on a large number of task factors rather than individual factors. This paper first demonstrates that the effect of one variable (age) is similar in a study of 45 subjects using a non-compact object to that found in previous studies using compact objects. A model is proposed to predict lifting performance from a large number of task-related variables. A test of the model using the effects of five variables estimated from the literature was conducted. Twenty-six lifting conditions were tested and the model predictions matched the actual weights lifted with a correlation coefficient of 0-936. The implications for future extension of the model are discussed. © 1975, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1975,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By applying rings of blows to a thin disc with the hammer face oriented circum-ferentially or radially, various axi-symmetric distributions of internal stress may be set up. Theoretical stresses were used for calculating changes in stiffness in various harmonic modes of flexure. Hence, effects of distributions of the two types of blow were assessed.

"The possibility of using pulse rate during work as a measure of the energy coat of that work, in lieu of the more cumbersome gas analysis techniques, has been examined in actual industrial environments for varied work and thermal loads. Three sets of data from some hot dry industries situated in different parts of India were analysed: (a) extreme levels; (b) moderate levelB; and (c) comparatively low levels of work and heat loads. Pulse rate (PR) measurements, in conjunction with body surface area (BSA) and corrected effective temperature (CET) were found to be significantly correlated with energy expenditure (EE) at both high and moderate levels (τ = 0-889 and 0-902, respectively); the predictive ability of the corresponding regression coefficients was also high (SE of estimate—± 10%). PR was also found to bear a linear relationship with work load at various levels of heat stress. Further, it was evident that at all levels (a), (b) and (c), the effect of work effort on observed pulse rate was more significant than that of heat exposure during work in hot environments. From the observed relationships between PR, CET and BSA, on the one hand, and EE, on the other, it could be suggested that it is possible to predict the physiological cost of work from easily measurable parameters on the shop floor. © 1975, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1975,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A group of Faculty members of the School of Industrial Management at Purdue University have for some time been engaged in studies of decision making in a large, decentralized American manufacturing company. These studies have investigated decisions at the mills producing raw material and the converting plants of this fully integrated company. Examinations have been made of decision processes within and between company plants with the objective of adding to theory of behavior in organizations, particularly theory of working relations and theory of cognitive processes in the carrying out of complex organizational tasks, and application of theory to the solution of practical problems, such as those of scheduling production and of formal organization. This paper discusses one of these projects, an attempt to construct a behavioral model of the decision rules actually employed to schedule orders for production in one of the firm's plants. This project has sought to embody decision rules in a computer program which will, in fact, take incoming data on orders and plant capacity and convert this into an operating schedule in a manner highly analogous to that of the human schedulers who performed this task.† The following discussion avoids technical details, since the aim of this paper is to give an overall picture of the major purpose and problems of this type of research; to describe its origin and to suggest possible future application as seen by the researchers. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1964,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In this paper, we present two network based algorithms for solving Type 1 assembly line balancing problems. These algorithms are based on the generation of the network of feasible subsets; the shortest path through this network corresponds to the minimum cost solution. While the methods presented here may require the generation of all feasible subsets, they use upper and lower bounds and dominance to eliminate many of these subsets. The first method (which we call the Frontscan algorithm) evaluates nodes in a manner similar to a procedure originally suggested by Mansoor (1967); the second procedure (which we call the Backscan algorithm) evaluates nodes by proceeding backwards through the network. Both procedures are quite versatile and are easily adapted to the line balancing problem with stochastic task times, duplicate parallel work stations, zoning restrictions, etc. Computational tests indicate that these algorithms are more efficient than previous network based methods (including dynamic programming methods) and favourably compare with branch and bound methods.

"A considerable amount of research has been conducted into the use of decision rules for scheduling in the job-shop environment. The research discussed in this paper is of a similar nature but concerned with the use of rules for controlling the service operation to semi-automatic machines where, the. run times and service times are, in the main, deterministic. The set of rules studied is different to those of the job-shop scheduling problem since the. products are manufactured, under batch conditions. Producing for stock means that delivering dates are not important but the idle time of machines is very important. The behaviour of a set of ten rules is studied and their performance measured by four different, but reasonable, criteria. The results of the study indicate that under most conditions and measured by several, but not all, of the criteria used, the rule serve the machine, awaiting service with shortest required service time, performs best.

"This paper describes techniques used to model a live close-coupled production-distribution system. The model's purpose was to study dynamic behaviour and thus appraise current system performance. It concerns a specific case study undertaken within the time-scales typical of industrial projects. A conceptual understanding of the production-distribution system was gained using Input-Output analysis and the study of time-series data. This work was then used as a base for a continuous computer simulation model using the DYNAMO language. The steps taken to build this model are outlined along with any compromises needed to describe specific details. This is followed by a discussion of the observed behaviour characteristics that were verified by the model including the amplification of the demand pattern as orders passed from the retail outlets, through the distributor, and finally onto the factory shopfloor. The description concludes by considering the results of a sensitivity analysis on the model and the recommendations for improved system design. There is found to be an emerging need for a theoretical understanding of the dynamic characteristics of basic structures recurring in manufacturing system designs from which similar studies could benefit. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The paper explains how simple ideas in the field of group technology have led to the development of a new system of production, called the cell system, which differs from, but complements, flow-line production and traditional ‘ job and batch ’ (functional layout-based) production. The cell system is not just a simple arrangement of similar components and similar tooling, but a new system of production, which, like the flow-line system, has rules and conditions for its practice. Only in the last two years has group technology developed sufficiently for a theory to begin to emerge. With now production systems today, it is not enough to deal only with ‘ engineering ’ or ‘ production ’, but present clay systems must be concerned with the complex interaction of market, management, machines, and men. This paper shows the importance of the cell system at different levels, beginning with the lowest, and leads the reader towards a rather different approach to the management of an engineering, or other multi-product firm.

"In many manufacturing organizations, batch production is an everyday occurrence. Usually, the batch size may range from less than ten parts to thousands. The majority of batch manufacturing in the US is in batches of 100 parts or less. Unless adequate control is exercised, potential sources of operational improvements on batch manufacturing systems can be easily overlooked. Two main time consuming activities encountered in batch manufacturing are operations at the workstation level and material handling. Parts can be handled individually or in small lots. In this paper, a methodology for selecting the machining parameters at each workstation and the material flow plan in a multi-stage production system is presented. The model objective is to minimize total production cost. A forward dynamic programming algorithm imbedded within a unidimensional search algorithm is used in seeking a solution to the model. The procedure can be easily computerized for use as a regular shop planning system. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With increasing market competition and the need to serve diverse market segments, many companies are responding to customer needs by manufacturing parts in small batches. Unless properly planned, batch production can lead to high material handling time. In this paper, a methodology for selecting the best routeing for a batch in a multi-stage production system with material handling considerations is presented. Each stage consists of multiple, functionally identical machines that have non-identical characteristics. The model determines the optimal routeing for the batch and generates the number of parts to handle or transport at a time as a unit load between machines in order to minimize total batch manufacturing time. The result from the model provides the optimal routeing (i.e., the machine to use at each production stage) and the number of parts to move at a time as a sub-lot. The solution procedure developed is easy to use and can be incorporated as a daily shop management tool. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Process planning and inventory control are important manufacturing functions; proper execution of these functions can result in large cost savings. Process planning is typically responsible for identification and sequencing of required manufacturing processes. Inventory control then uses the result of process planning activities to determine economic production quantities. Today, this sequential decision process is commonly used in industry. However, although easy to implement, it cannot guarantee that an overall minimum cost plan will be generated. An integrated approach to process planning and inventory control functions should presumably yield better results. Such an integrated approach is presented in this paper. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization model with sequence-dependent set-up and processing costs. Dynamic programming is used to solve the model. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The use of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) as transporters and mobile workstations in automated assembly lines is on the increase.

The use of the models permits the line designer to optimally determine the launch times of successive unit loads of parts into the line to minimize production makespan while balancing between line idleness and the idleness of vehicles employed on the line.

"A single-period, random demand inventory model is analyzed under the assumption that the replenishment quantity is a random function of the amount ordered. The structure of optimal policies is characterized for linear ordering cost functions, both with and without a setup cost. Generalizations of base-stock policies and (s, S) policies are shown to be optimal. Closed form analytic expressions for optimal policies are obtained for the special case of linear ordering cost and uniformly distributed demand. Optimal policies are compared with two heuristics in a more general demand environment. It is shown that a very simple heuristic policy performs quite well.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are many ways of constructing cost models for a given industrial operation. The model chosen for analysis in this paper is the factor inputs cost model, which (in its simplest form) consists of three component inputs: materials (M), labour (W), and other expenses (E). It is, of course, possible to disaggregate this cost function to a more detailed level to account for the cost of different material inputs and several types of labour inputs; similarly, the other expenses E may be disaggregated into depreciation, interest charges and various overhead cost items. The degree of detail to be included in the model depends on the circumstances and on the purpose of the analysis. Managers are interested in the effect of changes in the value of key variables on the total cost and on the unit cost, such as changes in any of the factor inputs and in output volume. These effects are derived in this paper through the use of incremental calculus (a description of which is given by the author in his latest book), and conditions are stated for the unit cost to decline. The following special cases are examined in this paper: (1) The percentage change in each of the factor inputs M, W and E is equal to the percentage change in output volume. (2) The material cost is proportional to output. (3) Material cost and output remain unchanged, but changes may take place in other factor inputs. (4) As ease 2 above, but the other expenses E remain constant. Labour productivity is defined as the ratio of physical volume to the number of hours worked, and it is not difficult to show that the unit labour cost multiplied by labour productivity equals the average hourly rate of pay (the unit labour cost is defined as the cost of labour per unit of output). Thus, changes in factor inputs can affect the level of productivity, which in turn may affect the total unit cost. These relationships provide the basis for determining the conditions under which the remuneration per employee can rise while the unit labour cost is expected to fall. Using the results of this analysis, various formulae for productivity-linked pay can be explored. © 1984 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A job shop is defined as a production centre consisting of several machines, each of which may be required for processing jobs of different makeups. The scheduling problem is concerned with determining the sequence in which these jobs should be processed on each machine, and this has led to several studies of alternative loading or priority rules. One rule, which has been found to be effective in reducing the average throughput time of jobs, is the SI rule, which can be described as follows: of jobs waiting in a queue to be processed on any given machine, select first the one with the shortest imminent processing time. The study described in this paper involved a simulation of a hypothetical shop with several machines. A number of alternative rules and variations on the SI rule were investigated. One modification of the SI rule called for the creation of two queues, one having a priority over the other and each queue involving an SI discipline. The decision as to which queue a job should belong to is determined by its float, which is defined as the difference between the time available until the prescribed due-date of the job and the time required for operations still outstanding. The effectiveness of this rule is investigated. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1968,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The generated segments represent samples from the population of profiles which could have been produced under the same machining conditions of the specimen. So, the study of the relation between profiles of surfaces in contact can be made simpler and the variability of results can be evaluated by considering several samples of simulated profiles.

However, there are industries where production must be carried out at given discrete levels, for example by the opening or closure of certain facilities or by the use of shift-working. The problem is to control the operation in a way that will minimize the cost of changes in the level of production. The method explored in this paper relies on inventory levels for control purposes to trigger a switch from one production level to another. Sample results from simulation runs are cited as examples. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It has now been generally established that the output rate of balanced production lines having variable operation times can be improved by deliberately unbalancing the line through assigning proportionately lower operation times to the middle station(s). Nevertheless, a production line may be balanced in terms of mean operation times at the respective stations yet unbalanced in the sense that the interstage buffer capacity allocation or the operation time variability are not equal for all stations. This paper attempts to study the effect that the latter types of imbalance have on the output rate and average number of work units in the system for some production line situations. Computer simulation experimentation results confirm that inequality of variability of operation times have the same general effect on output rate as inequality of operation times but little effect on the number of units in the system. Inequality of interstage buffers, on the other hand, affects the average number of units in the system but has little effect on the output rate. © 1979, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Three previous authors have presented some evidence in support of the hypothesis that the output rate of perfectly balanced lines with variable station (or operation) times can be improved by deliberately unbalancing the lines in different ways, i.e. through different methods of assigning unequal operation times to the respective stations. This paper reports on the rather extensive computer simulation experimentation undertaken with various configurations of production lines to compare the effectiveness of the three conjectures. Results confirm that only one of these conjectures—the ‘bowl-phenomenon’ method of assigning comparatively lower operation times to the middle stations—consistently results in better output rates than those of balanced lines as well as lines which are unbalanced in accordance with other methods. Although the ‘bowl-phenomenon’ method is found to exist in general, the extent of improvement over the output rate of balanced counterparts increases directly with the number of stations in the line and operation time variability and inversely with the interstage buffer capacity allowed in the line. Nevertheless, production lines of all lengths can be appreciably unbalanced according to the ‘bowl-phenomenon’ method without loss of output, particularly when interstage buffer capacity is small and operation time variability high. © 1979, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Most of the variation in linear measurements is caused by lack of proper consideration of the variables that can and do enter into any measurement. No matter how precise the instrument is, it does not correct the variables that the operator is supposed to take account of and make the proper corrections for. This paper shows that, under realistic conditions, a temperature gradient of 0’7°C across the slab of a granite surface table contributes to the uncertainty of flatness measurement by as much as 25-37% of the permissible tolerance on the granite surface table under consideration. © 1979, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The paper investigates uncertainties of both methods. Adopting statistical accuracy, the analysis of experimental data using the two methods demonstrated that both methods give almost the same value of error of straightness of the surface under test with the same uncertainty. Nevertheless, for practical application the end point line method is more favourable for not only does it offer a suitable mathematically defined datum but also it is simple, straightforward and independent of personal judgement. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The efficiency of an automatic transfer line can be improved by providing buffers between stages and/or installing redundant machines at selected stages. In this paper, two two-stage production-line systems where a buffer storage is provided between the production stages, are discussed. Each production stage consists of two machines in either a splitting or a stand-by arrangement The effects of the size of the buffer storage and .the use of redundant machines on line efficiencies for both machine arrangements have been studied theoretically and the results compared. For practical applications, the effects of various combinations of breakdown rate, repair rate and buffer size on the efficiency of production lines have also been determined and mathematical expressions are presented which can be used to estimate the efficiency of production systems operating under different combinations without solving the steady-state equations. . © 1986 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Two economic order quantity models (1 and II) for inventory items with deterioration rates are developed. In Model I, the demand is deterministic in nature, production rate is finite, and shortages are allowed. In Model II, the demand is given by a random variable having the p.d.f. of a normal distribution, the deterioration rate is given by a two-parameter Weibull distribution, and shortages are allowed. Numerical solutions are utilized to obtain optimal values for the order quantity (Q) and cycle time (T). The models are then applied to a real-life situation of the Stewart Clay Company.

"In this paper we present heuristics and analytical models for the order batching problem. Orders are batched into tours such that the total travel time is minimized. Four heuristics are developed for the order batching problem, for which no exact solution exists. All heuristics are based on the time-saving criterion of combining two or more orders in a single tour rather than processing them one order at a time. Among the heuristics that are presented, the SL algorithm has the best performance. An analytical model is developed to estimate the travel time of the S/R machine as a function of the number of locations to be visited and the physical specifications of the structure. Expressions for upper and lower bounds for travel time are presented. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In the past considerable know-how has been generated with respect to dimensional accuracy and the surface finish of machined workpieces, however, efficient methods are lacking for the improvement of the geometrical form generating capabilities of machine tools. In this paper a forecasting compensatory control scheme for the reduction of form errors in machining is presented. The approach considerably departs from traditional methods since it does not require a high precision machine tool for the achievement of high precision results. The basic underlying idea is to make use of advances in computer. sensor and actuator technologies in connection with on-line system identification methods, to implement a forecasting compensatory controller. The error motion component signals are sensed on-line by a microcomputer which develops a stochastic difference equation of error motion which in turn is used to forecast the future relative displacement between tool and workpiece forming the basis for a proper compensatory action. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated on examples of roundness and straightness control in grinding and milling respectively. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the increasing cost of labour and materials, preventive maintenance (PM) programmes are becoming more prevalent. For large companies and institutions, however, manually controlled PM programmes can be quite burdensome and inefficient. A computerized PM system is discussed in this paper that enables an institution or company with a large equipment inventory to establish a manageable, adaptive PM programme. The system centres around a prioritized, dynamic scheduling routine. All PM inspections are scheduled based on when they were actually last done, not when they were supposed to have been done. Since this creates the possibility of having more work than can be accomplished, priority functions were developed. These functions assign a priority to each inspection that is due, and the highest priority work is scheduled. This type of scheduling provides management with many capabilities that are not normally available. It also provides them with a system that is responsive to a transient environment. An actual ease study of the implemented system is also discussed in the paper. © 1983 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this paper, methods are suggested for solving a common class of job-shop scheduling problem. The type of job-shops considered consists of two parallel production lines ended by a group work station. The methods use a domination principle at first, of one line over the other, defining a master—slave hierarchy in the workshops. The solutions obtained from the optimal scheduling of the master line form the constraint domain of the slave line, the optimal schedules of which are worked out in turn. Parametrization of economical functions permits the dynamic modification of the optimization criteria of the slave line. © 1978, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1978,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The scheduling of jobs on machines in a job-shop is considered using a multilevel decision-making structure. The levels are coordinated by considering as constraints on one level the decision made on the preceding level. For job-shop scheduling a tool is proposed to enable one to find and to analyse the set of feasible schedules in the light of the decision taken on the previous level. The information obtained as to the earliest starting and latest finishing times for performing the operations, as well as the logical sequence constraints acts as decision aids for the scheduling of the operations. The decision is made by choosing, from amongst the actions which are possible in the light of the overall objective, an action which takes into account secondary elements and considerations particular to the job-shop. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We consider the problem of a, machine shop in which some items are made specially to customor order while other items are made for and subsequently sold from finished goods inventory. It is assumed that both types use the same set of facilities in their manufacture. However, whereas we may have some choice in the timing of replenishment orders which are manufactured for stock, the demands for make-to-order items will not generally permit the same degree of freedom. Consequently when congestion difficulties arise through facility overloading it is often the ‘ stock orders ’ which arc forced to wait. In this case study we present an attempt to measure the relationship between the level of shop congestion and the degree of retardation of stock leadtimes. Clearly if correlation exists, then we might conversely be able to assess maximum loading levels in the light of the stock leadtimes which are deemed to be desirable. © 1973 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Economic work measurement can now be successfully achieved in many areas by the integrated use of the various systems in the M.T.M. family. A related area is that of comparative estimating in which jobs are allocated by the planner to a time interval and then assigned the single time associated with that interval. This paper examines two different methods of time (distance) interval selection— one from each area, and discusses the implications of these different bases on managerial decision making. It is suggested that in practice comparative estimating may have much to offer, and the paper concludes with comments on planner estimation error, showing that there appears to be a unique best solution for any particular environment, although this may be insensitive near the optimum. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The equipment replacement theory usually assumes a uniform distribution of the major variables in the model, e.g., salvage values, expected maintenance cost and purchase price of a replacement item. However, in practice, the assumption of uniform characteristics of the variables is not always valid, furthermore, when the data points are few and the normality assumption is violated, the least squares regression method provides unreliable posterior estimates. In this paper, an attempt was made to derive an optimum decision by employing the robust regression method. It was shown that the optimum decision derived by the least squares method is. in fact, a suboptimum decision when the identical problem is solved via the robust method. © 1982 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Consider a printed circuit board with N signal paths in which k (not known a priori) paths are subjected to electrical shorts. A straight forward technique to detect all shorts is to test each pair of signal paths separately. This method needs (N2— N)/2 tests. In order to reduce the testing effort, manufacturers introduced a device that could test a group of signal paths against another group of signal paths. With the help of this device, a method with N + ((k2—k)/) tests needed was patented in 1982.

"This paper presents a single machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent changeover times. An optimizing solution procedure and various appropriate heuristics are reviewed. The performance of these and other heuristics in the dynamic situation, as new jobs arrive to be processed and have to be added into the existing schedule at some time are considered. An ideal solution would be to reschedule as each new job arrived, but as this is not generally practical from a computational viewpoint, it has to be carried out less frequently. The actual frequency of this rescheduling is clearly of importance, and some of the heuristics are more adaptable to this than others. Some results are presented which attempt to quantify this adaptability for the heuristics in question, and it is demonstrated that best heuristic for the static problem is not necessarily the best heuristic in the dynamic situation.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper reports the major findings to date of an investigation into the human aspects of group technology and cellular manufacture. The project is part of a larger multi-disciplinary multi-institutional research programme financed by Britain's Science Research Council. Initially the benefits following the introduction of group technology were seen to be economic and technological. Recently claims have been made which suggest that it is the social benefits which are likely to be the most significant in the future. The paper assesses these claims in the light of observations made on the impact of group technology in the following areas: (1)Worker flexibility and job variety. (2)The importance of the social group. 3)Reduction in frustration. (4)Improvements in material working conditions. (5)Status and security. This is followed by a note on the reaction of trade unions to the implementation of group technology. The paper concludes with (1) a plea for more research into batch manufacturing systems; (2) the suggestion that too much academic research is geared to proving preconceived theories rather than describing reality: (3) the belief that unless researchers are prepared to make judgments about what they find their work will be of little interest or utility to practising managers; (4) the statement that group technology and cellular manufacture are worthy of consideration for wider application as they offer the opportunity to make more effective use of present technological knowledge resulting in both economic and social benefits. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The integration of production systems and social values must be seen to be taking place within a continuously changing environment Up to the end of this century it seems inevitable that the stress on technological development will continue.

In addition to the threat of socially-induced, large scale unemployment, there are the problems of employee boredom and dissatisfaction It is suggested that where viable group methods of working are introduced It is concluded that, although deterministic statements about the future are impractical, planned-for change is more likely to be successful than accidental change and hence future social needs should be an important criterion in determining current research activity. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The response of a cutting force dynamometer system is often complicated by resonances, in or near the pass band of the instrument, and by cross sensitivity between nominally orthogonal measurement axes. Transfer functions are frequently used to describe such a response, but are difficult to determine by sinusoidal excitation methods. Transient loading techniques, however, give this information much more rapidly and this aids the development of instruments with suitably placed first resonances. It may then be possible to assume that the transfer functions are constant and frequency independent and to correct simply for the effects of cross sensitivity. © 1982 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Traditionally the grinding process has been a finishing process and the operating parameters and the results obtained in this mode are well known. However, there is an increasing demand for the use of high rates of metal removal grinding and when allied with the application of adaptive control this has highlighted a need to be able to predict the forces that will be generated during grinding operations. The work reported is part of an overall programme to study the effects of different dressing tools, wheel speeds, metal removal rates and dress leads on grinding ratio, surface finish and grinding forces. From the results obtained for grinding forces it will be shown that various factors in the dressing and grinding operations influence the initial and subsequent levels of grinding force. These factors are discussed and empirical formulae developed to predict levels of normal and tangential force during grinding. The developed formulae utilise commonly specified parameters in the grinding process and are more easily applied than those of other researchers which rely on measurements obtained during testing. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The relationship between the normal and tangential forces in grinding has been the subject of a number of research reports. There is a broad measure of agreement that the relationship between these forces is based on the coefficient of friction and a constant, the value of which is dependent on the grinding process parameters. This paper further considers the nature of the relationship between the forces, and using previously published values and results, advances empirical formulae to show how the values for the coefficient of friction and the constant will vary for a range of wheel speeds, metal removal rates and dressing leads. The value for the coefficient of friction is shown to be highly dependent on the heat input to the process, thus confirming some of the conclusions of earlier research. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Productivity increases attributed to the Japanese management approach known as just-in-time (JIT) include better customer service, higher quality levels, increased labour and machine efficiency and reduced inventory levels. These potential benefits, as well as others, have caused many large companies to examine JIT. Most of this interest has been focused on JIT applications for large repetitive manufacturers. Research, and the experiences of some managers, indicate its potential in job-shop and process industry environments. Little research has been conducted in small manufacturing environments. This paper examines JIT, its elements, benefits and feasibility in a small manufacturing setting. A bottling company is described and examined in terms of its suitability for JIT implementation. This example shows that not all elements of JIT are feasible for all situations. Each element of a JIT system should be examined as it applies to small or large manufacturing or to repetitive, job-shop of process industries.

"This study develops a set of preventive maintenance policies, based on the idea of critical machines, for use in group technology shops. These policies designated certain machines in the shop as critical. When a critical machine breaks down, it is repaired and preventive maintenance is applied to a block of machines (either the remaining machines in the cell, the other machines of the same type or all of the remaining machines in the shop). Simulation of a complex group technology shop was used to compare twelve definitions of criticality and three preventive maintenance conditions. The definition of criticality was not found to be a major cause of performance differences between shops, since in many cases, the same machines were critical by any definition. The application of preventive maintenance to all machines in the shop when a critical machine had failed led to the best shop performance, indicating that the reduction in machine interference caused by doing so was more important than the unique features of group technology. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A simulation model of an actual job shop was used to compare group technology with traditional job shop manufacturing. The experiment compared shops which had four different layouts, designed to emphasize different features of traditional job shops and group technology shops, and four distributions of demand for end items. The group technology shops exhibited superior performance in terms of average move time and average set-up time. The traditional job shops had superior performance in queue related variables (average queue length, average waiting time, work-in-process inventory, etc.). This was caused by group technology's dedication of machines. The effects of the queue related variables outweighed the effects of average move time and average set-up time: the average flow time was shorter in the traditional job shop than in the group technology shops. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When the average setup time is shorter, machines are available for processing relatively more time, leading to an increase in shop ouput capacity. In this simulation experiment, setup times are lowered, both by implemention family grouping and through the use of a sequence dependent setup time based scheduling procedure. The results clearly showed that reduced setup times led to greater output capacity. The higher input rate in the models with increased capacity, however, had a detrimental effect on many other performance variables in the shop. Some of this detrimental effect was alleviaed by the use of a scheduling procedure which was designed to capitalize on the sequence dependent nature of setup times.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seppanen and Moore considered an important subproblem: that of the optimal specification of which facilities are to be adjacent in the final layout without regard to the area or shape of the individual facilities. They present a string processing heuristic which relies on using a test for graph planarity. This paper further develops their graph theoretic formulation of the problem. This development is used to present two procedures which usually yield near-optimal solutions. The procedures circumvent the considerable difficulty of graph planarity testing by working entirely within a family of graphs known to be planar and also to contain the solution. Ways of improving suboptimal solutions are discussed. Computational experience in using the methods on a variety of problems suggests that the methods are efficient. © 1978, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1978,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper describes a pilot study conducted to investigate the performance of operators under paced conditions in a particular form of conveyor-paced working. The response shown by the operator is reflected grossly by a speeding-up in work rate The study aims particularly at investigating whether the service time for a part, delivered on the conveyor, will depend upon the time available before the next part would be missed and pass unprocessed. The feed rate and the position in the pick-up area in which a part is picked up arc shown to affect the service time with different ce:degrees of magnitude. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1966,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We begin with the part-oriented definition of a workcell task in terms of generic elementary actions to be performed. These actions are then mapped to a workcell-element-oriented description of the operations to be executed to perform the task. When the workcell task is repetitive, the notion of a workcell cycle becomes important, and we can associate with each workcell element a repetitive sequence of operations. In this paper, we shall demonstrate that workcell programming is more than just a matter of sequencing, since there may exist alternative cycles inherent in the same specification of the workcell tasks. These alternatives are then compared in terms of cycle time, task throughput, task-processing rate, and machine utilization. But even for simple workcell tasks, the space of possible time evolutions of workcell behaviour can be very large, with many different workcell cycles. To automate such sequence analysis, we therefore present a Prolog-based decision-support system called SAGE (sequence analysis by generalized enumeration). Three simple examples are used to illustrate our approach. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper presents an argument that since the proportion of product cost which represents direct labour is diminishing and the material content cost is increasing, western firms are shifting their production management paradigm from one of maximizing the utilization of capacity to one of minimizing the need for inventory. With this shift in management emphasis is coming the acceptance of unavoidable idle time at some work stations. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming formulation which optimizes the sequence of jobs through a single facility and which places the correct amount of idle time between jobs to minimize the sum of earliness and tardiness penalties. Although this formulation reaches an optimal solution in every instance, the computation lime required was found to grow in an exponential manner as the number of jobs considered increased. Given the cost of computing at present, there appears to be a need for more computationally efficient heuristics to solve this problem. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Single-stage job-shop scheduling has received a great deal of attention in the published literature. Significantly less research has been done in the area of assembly job shops. With the onslaught of MRP implementations designed to plan and control assembly job shops, practitioners have been confronted head-on with the need to improve dispatching procedures. This paper examines the effect of three different product structures on the performance of selected priority dispatching rules in a six-machine assembly job shop. Results indicate that significant relationships exist between the structure of the product bill of materials and the priority dispatching rule, and that specific rules are indeed better suited to certain product structures. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the multistage job shop, several parts are assembled to form sub-assemblies which are then assembled into final products. Job delays may occur due to the lack of capacity and also due to the lack of component parts necessary to form a subassembly. Previous research of similar systems have assumed a balanced capacity. A more realistic assumption is one in which machine capacities are not balanced such that one machine can be identified as a bottleneck. In this paper, the performance of selected dispatching rules in an unbalanced multistage job shop is evaluated to-determine whether the performance is consistent for jobs which are routed through the bottleneck and for jobs which by-pass the bottleneck. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A number of multiple-parameter adaptive exponential smoothing models have been proposed and demonstrated over the last two decades for short range forecasting. There have been conflicting results on their performance and no systematic study has been conducted to compare them in a controlled environment. The work reported here fills this void by testing a set of well known multiple-parameter adaptive procedures against the three-parameter Winters' model. First, sets of synthetic time series with known characteristics are used to compare performance for the different approaches using the standard deviation of forecast errors. Second, the information gathered at this point is used to predict the technique's performance on six empirical time series.

"This paper estimates the potential market for robotic assembly. The potential market is defined in terms of: (i) the percentage of assembly; (ii) the number of displaced workers and (iii) the number of installed robots, where robots are a lower-cost method than conventional techniques (hard automatic and manual). It also estimates the effects of developments in visual sensing for part recognition, tactile sensing for flexible grippers and reduced control engineering costs (software) on the economics and potential market for robotic assembly. Though the primary concern is to estimate future, as opposed to existing, costs of robotic assembly, many of the cost estimates are bad on systems that are currently available.

"Given the dynamic finished good requirements, a model is presented to derive the optimal levels of inventory, backlogging, and machine loading in a multi-stage, multi-period production environment characterized by non-identical machines in each stage. Dynamic capacity constraints on the level of inventory, backlogging, and machine loading are included. Furthermore, capacities and operating costa of machines performing the same tasks at any stage in the production process are permitted to vary in order to consider the individual characteristics of machines. Therefore, machine loads are obtained for non-identical machines capable of performing the same operations. The model is represented as a capacitated network with linear costa and is quickly solved using a standard network code. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rapid technological innovation and the multiplicity of pertinent assembly design features mean that large quantities of information have to be processed for assembly-suitable designing. In order to be able to utilize purposefully the knowledge obtained in this way, the designer must be able to discover the weak points in the design with respect to automated assembly. In view of the complex interrelationships between the design features and the assembly effort and the constantly shorter development times for the product, the designer is overtaxed in the solution *of the problem. If he must nevertheless incorporate the requirements of a simple product assembly into the design, the assembly experts have the job of providing him with the proper aids for assembly-appropriate designing. This article presents solution rudiments for such aids. The processes described disclose the inherent mathematical interrelationships of a design with respect to the assembly effort and assist in analysing a product with reference to its suitability for assembly. The processes are based predominantly on heuristic inceptions. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Machinability equations have been developed for prediction of tool life when machining XC 45 steel with P 10 and P 30 carbide inserts. A marked difference in cutability was observed between separate batches of P 10 inserts. A new criterion of tool life is suggested. Equations are developed relating cutting forces to cutting conditions and to tool wear measurements. It is suggested that the percentage increase of the feed force may be suitable as a monitor of tool performance. The effect of cratering upon feed force is discussed and it is concluded that cratering should not necessarily affect feed force. A slight positive correlation between cutting force and cutting speed has been observed for the radial and feed forces but not for the vertical cutting force. © 1971 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is necessary to add data concerning the structure of operation. Non-technical and organisational factors in production—age, length of time on job, etc.—can affect the degree of monotony, but are not of primary importance.

"A model for describing form feature geometry is presented. The model treats form features as volumes enveloped by entry/exit and depth boundaries. The geometric characteristics of a feature are decided by the degree of accessibility to its volume, its boundary type, its exit boundary status and its form variation with respect to its depth axis. A hierarchical structure for form features classification is also presented. Based on their geometric characteristics, features are classified into categories, classes and sub-classes. These can be followed by secondary forms to fully describe compound features. The feature description method together with the associated hierarchy provide a very flexible model for feature description and classification. The model is of direct relevance to many of the CAD/CAM activities and contain concepts that can help to ease their integration. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The paper deals with the orthogonal machining characteristics of anisotropic and normal stress sensitive polymers. Tensile and compression tests were carried out to define the mechanical properties of the chosen polymers, nylon and polycarbonate. The deformation during cutting is assumed to occur under plain strain conditions and a suitable yield equation is chosen to describe the material yielding behaviour. For the cutting process, a single shear plane model is assumed and the minimum energy criterion applied to the appropriate yield criterion to develop a representative shear angle relationship, which depends on the mechanical state of the chosen polymer. Orthogonal cutting tests were carried out varying three main parameters; cutting speed, tool rake angle and depth of cut. Measured forces and shear angles are compared with the values predicted from the theoretical analysis and an excellent correlation is obtained. It is concluded that, for the assumed mode of deformation, the minimum energy criterion applied to a representative yield equation is justified in explaining polymer behaviour under orthogonal cutting conditions. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An experimental investigation has been carried out into the machining of polymers which exhibit both anisotropic and normal stress sensitive characteristics. The cutting mechanism is analysed using a modified shear angle relationship based on the mechanical properties of the chosen polymers and the minimum energy criterion. From cutting tests, the material shear stress is estimated and hence cutting forces calculated. The presence of a critical rake angle at which the normal force equals zero has been confirmed. The value of critical rake angle can be estimated from force predictions. The coefficient of friction for polymers was found to decrease with increasing the normal force on the tool rake face. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An experimental investigation has been carried out into the drilling of glass fibre reinforced plastics using HSS twist drills. A test series was conducted using a wide range of cutting conditions and drill geometry, namely cutting speed, feed rate, point angle and helix angle. Decisions relating to the ‘optimum’ drilling conditions were based on the geometrical accuracy and appearance of the produced holes. Drill wear was measured during the test trials and used as a further constraint in ‘optimum’ cutting conditions selection. Speed, feed rate and drill point angle were found statistically to be the most significant parameters influencing hole quality. Drill wear can be successfully correlated to the level of the thrust force. A simple nomogram is included to predict drill wear level from the thrust level or the amount of material removed. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Time structure of a job is affected by the length and frequency of its constituting tasks. It is probably one of the major variables in the subjective perception of variety of jobs. This paper defines an index called Non-Repetitive Cycle Time (NRCT) which can be used as an indicator of the temporal pattern of the job. Investigation of the value of NRCT for jobs in two organizations confirmed the hypothesis that NRCT is positively correlated with the job level in the organizational hierarchy. This index can be used by job designers in estimating the temporal impact of assigning tasks to jobs. © 1983 Taylor and Francis Ltd.,1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This study investigates the influence of monetary incentive and type of instructions given to operators on the spread of actual data points around two possible learning models; the linear and the power models. The investigation is based on a laboratory study in which subjects were asked to perform a specific task in different conditions of learning: with or without incentive, and with or without exact specifications according to which the task had to be performed. The value of the spread for these four cases was measured by the coefficient of variation and other similar indicators. Analysis of the spread points to the following major conclusions: (a) with the introduction of an incentive system the spread reduces by approximately 20%; (6) when an exact work method is specified, the spread reduces; (c) the coefficient of variation reached an average value as high as 0-28. Finally, a numerical example shows how the coefficient of variation can be used to improve the estimate of batch production time. © 1984 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper develops a learning curve model adjusted to a Group Technology environment which explicitly accounts for shared learning that occurs when multiple products utilise some of the same process steps. The estimates provided by the group technology learning curve model are then compared with those generated by employing the traditional model. A series of experiments was conducted to examine the impact of important parameters on the differences in resource estimates generated by the two models. The results indicate that when the process commonality among products is perfect, the basic learning curve model overstates the estimated resources needed by over one hundred per cent. As the learning rate increases, the per cent difference in models increases also. In addition, when the scheduled production quantity increases, the basic learning curve model overstates resource requirements by two-thirds. These results indicate the critical importance of employing the adjusted group technology learning curve model when a process spans multiple products. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Operational and financial measures deserve comparable attention. They both reveal information needed for sound management, but the measurement of operating performance is often neglected, especially in the white-collar and service sectors. An operational control system can be constructed by identifying several performance criteria that represent an organizational unit's mission, establishing satisfactory and superior levels of performance for the criteria, and determining the relative weight of each criterion in accomplishing the mission. The ‘objectives matrix’ formats a process for developing performance objectives and indicators. It has been widely adopted for its visual, motivational and multi-dimensional properties. By measuring work-unit performance along several dimensions, a manager is better prepared to make short-term operating decisions that promote long-term organizational productivity. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many industrial and service processes are performed by using lines composed of a number of sequential and parallel work stations. Certain production rates can be attained either by using a single line, or parallel lines with less stations. The design of a job, or process, has an impact on human behaviour and thus on production performance. Incorrect job design may lead to absenteeism and turnover. Absenteeism causes fluctuations in production, and turnover may slow it down. Correct job design decreases the sensitivity of the technical system to the human one; if instead of a single line, two parallel lines are used, the production system is less sensitive to absenteeism, since the absence of a person disturbs only one half of the system. This paper develops a simulation model to examine the influence of various job design strategies (number of parallel lines) on human behaviour (learning, absenteeism, turnover), the system’s response time and percent of work accomplished. The model has been tuned to a specific process and results demonstrate that in certain cases a compromise strategy which consists of a few parallel lines is better than each one of the extreme strategies, where a single line of n stations or n parallel lines of one stations are used. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The guide path layout for an automated guided vehicle system (AGVS) is a critical component in the overall design of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) that utilizes AGVs for materials handling. Not only does it affect the total distance travelled by the vehicles but it also affects vehicle requirements and space utilization. In this study, the problem of selecting the guide path as well as the location of pick-up and drop-off points for outward and inward bound parts to departments is addressed.

"A heuristic algorithm for solving the quadratic assignment formulation to the plant layout problem is presented. The algorithm involves deriving an initial assignment of departments to sites (a construction phase) and then, possibly, improving the solution through exchange between pairs of departments. A ‘classical’ numerical example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness, costwise and in terms of computational effort, of the algorithm. Finally, a set of examples previously used by various authors is assembled and solved in the Appendix. Results are compared to optimal solution values and to the average solution of another known heuristic.

"This paper describes a method for determining repair policies for machines whose output degrades additively over time. The novelty of the models is that they consider both the state of the machines as well as the state of the repair facility when making repair decisions. The objective in the models is to maximize long-run production. In one model, we approximate the queue waiting time by a geometric random variable, while in the second model we approximate the waiting time by a sequence of geometric random variables (with different means). We show that as the average repair queue increases, the decision to repair must be made earlier. In addition, we show empirically that the simple geometric waiting time approximation becomes less accurate as the queue length increases and that the approximation understates the expected long-run output of the machine. A plastic moulding facility is used to motivate the problem. Computational results using industry supplied data are presented. The results indicate that substantial (10-20%) productivity improvement can be realized using the derived repair policies instead of policies that do not consider the repair queue. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Computerized shop floor scheduling is probably one of the most glaring examples of an area in which the tremendous efforts and investments of a large number of companies have produced at best only a partial solution. One of the more successful attempts is known as OPTR (optimized production technology) on which numerous papers have been published highlighting the various aspects of this package. What was realized by only a small group of people, namely the user base, was that this package was evolving at an incredible rate from one year to the next. This article describes that evolutionary process from basically a computerized Kanban to an attempted computerization of the Drum-Buffer-Rope technique. The major emphasis will not be so much on the technical developments, but more on the reasoning—gained from the experience of implementing this package—that brought this evolution so quickly to its ultimate conclusion. Namely, the real key lies mainly in the conceptual framework under which we run our organizations. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The uncertainty inherent in material requirements planning (MRP) systems is of two general types: demand uncertainty and supply uncertainty. Supply uncertainty is a result of late deliveries (timing) or order shrinkage (quantity) or both. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of operating policies on an MRP system given supply uncertainty resulting from timing factors, specifically the uncertainty caused by variability in the lead time of purchased parts. Experiments arc conducted to assess the impact of four factors: the amount of lead time variability, the amount of safety stock or safety lead time, the lot-size rule, and the holding cost and lateness penalty, on the total cost of the MRP system given supply/timing uncertainty. An MRP/Production simulator is employed to perform the experiments.

"The problems associated with chip removal during profile boring are highlighted and the effect of using a chip curler pad on the rake face of ISO triangular inserts investigated. The chip types obtained by varying the geometry of the chip curler pads are observed and the conditions under which a forward flowing continuous helical chip is obtained are determined. This chip type is of use when machining ‘through holes’ where the chip can flow along the bore in advance of the boring bar, through the hollow lathe spindle to be collected at the rear of the lathe. This method of chip collection simplifies chip removal problems in profile boring. Some illustrative examples of the effect of cutting conditions on chip radius and pitch of the chip helix are given and the chip form is shown to depend on the workpiece geometry in addition to the Cutting tool/chip curler geometry. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The existing economic analyses of metal cutting processes enable the machining conditions to be identified which correspond to such things as minimum cost or maximum production rate. The work presented in this paperextends a previously published analysis for the deep hole drilling process where wear occurs at both cutting edge and pads. The minimum cost analysis showed that the interaction between the cutting edge and burnishing pads wear resulted in a cost-feed-speed surface exhibiting a number of marked steps, an effect not present in conventional single point analyses. This extension of the analysis involves investigation into the effects of the strategy adopted for the final regrinding of the drill where cost penalties may be incurred under certain circumstances.

"Efficient sequencing of a mix of end-products in a final assembly shop is particularly well suited for a pull manufacturing environment, such as just-in-time (JIT). Since each product imposes different requirements on the feeder shops, in terms of parts' production, the feeder shops are driven by the sequence of final assembly. We developed a mathematical model and an algorithm for the final-assembly sequencing (FAS) problem. Our model links the FAS problem to smoothing the work-in-process levels of parts in the feeder shops. We designed an efficient local search procedure, based on selective pairwise interchanges, to solve a lexicographic minimax formulation of the FAS problem. Extensive testing revealed that the algorithm consistently provided excellent results in a tractable running time. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The wide gap between mathematical theory and the building of an actual model is stressed, particularly the necessary, and often difficult, task of adapting known theoretical results to a specific problem.

"Conventional economic analyses of metal cutting processes enable the machining condition to be identified which correspond to such criteria as minimum cost, maximum production rate and maximum profit. Such analyses have been applied extensively to single point cutting processes such as turning and to a lesser degree to multi-point cutting processes such as milling. However, there are other more complex processes that employ cutting tools, where a number of cutting and deformation edges act simultaneously to remove material. The conditions are not necessarily the same at each edge. Examples of such processes are broaching, subland drilling and deep drilling, all of which have primary and secondary machining regions. In this paper the economics of deep drilling are presented and it is shown that the wear at the secondary region (i.e. the pads which burnish the hole surface) affects the economics of the primary region (the cutting edge) in a manner which had not been previously appreciated. A minimum cost analysis is presented which shows the cost-feed-speed surface is not a continuous smooth curve as is the case for conventional tools, but consists of a series of steps or discontinuities joined by curves. Thus, a minimum cost can be determined between consecutive discontinuities which may be considered with production rate in order to decide the optimum machining conditions. The presence of discontinuities can also result in relatively large variations in cost for small changes in machining conditions. © 1984 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In all production-inventory planning situations one of the major cost items to be considered is the capital cost for products in inventory and in the chain of process. In practical life as well as in theoretical models such costs are usually determined as a product value multiplied by an interest rate, where this value is computed on a cost-added basis: materials, labour, share of overheads, etc. In this paper we formulate models in which the physical production processes and their associated cash flow are analysed. By computing the present value of the cash flow as a function of characteristics of the production process, this value will also reflect a correct overall capital cost. Adjusting parameters of the physical process will then disclose what values to ascribe to products at different stages of production and assembly. It is shown that usual accounting principles often yield too conservative product values at early stages of production and that if percentage factors for covering overheads, etc., are to be used for evaluating work-in-progress, such factors should exceed the overall ratio between profits plus fixed overheads and variable costs. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a previous paper Miller describes a hedging strategy that distributes safety stock throughout the product structure. This paper investigates thedynamic behaviour of such a system in the presence of uncertain demand. Compared to holding a planned buffer only at the finished goods level, this strategy reduces inventory investment at the cost of slightly lower service. Additionally, when planned replenishment rates for safety stock are decreased, the average level of inventory is also decreased with minor loss of service. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is further assumed that the routing may be different for different jobs and a job may return to a machine more than once. © 1982 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Multistage production systems have been an important quest of researchers over many years. While much work has been reported in this area little appears to have been done when recycling, an inevitable factor in any production system, is present. In this paper, a model for optimal production batch quantity as well as optimal recycling lot size has been developed with a view to minimizing the total operational cost of such situations, where recycling takes place only from the last stage to the first. The model has been validated using sample data from a glassworks, located in Western India. The effects of changes of model parameters were also studied and practical guidelines arising out of the same have been provided. © 1984 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A two stage model for joint optimization of production volume and communication system cost for a multi-product manufacturing system has been developed. Stage I minimizes penalty cost, which includes costs due to under-achievement of production targets and over-fulfilment of production capacities, and determines the optimal production volumes in order to achieve the desired production plan with the available physical capacities at various stations. Stage II determines optimal design parameters for communication systems while minimizing the total penalty cost and achieving the near-optimal production volumes of stage I. A case example is discussed thereafter which illustrates the importance of joint optimization of resources as against independent optimization. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper presents a similarity coefficient based approach to the problem of machine-component grouping. The proposed method incorporates relevant production data such as part type production volume, routing sequence and unit operation time in the early stages of grouping decisions for cellular manufacturing. The algorithm also suggests a methodology for evaluating alternative solutions from different algorithms on a quantitative basis using a modified version of an existing coefficient. The modified quantitative measure is a comprehensive indicator for the goodness of a grouping solution. The algorithm then identifies bottleneck machines and corresponding cell candidates for their duplication using percentage utilization in each cell as a criterion. Finally, additional constraints can be applied to determine the best grouping solution among alternative solutions generated by the algorithm. A software package has been developed to verify the implementation. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Just-in-time production systems are gaining tremendous popularity in modern production environments. Based on the concept of producing exactly the required quantity and type of products, these systems display an excellent ability to adapt to changes in demand as well as permitting greatly reduced work-in-process inventories. JIT systems often make reference to ‘kanbans’, which are the inventory control cards used in most JIT environments. A JIT-kanban system is one where production is pulled through the process rather than conventional materials requirements planning push. This fundamental difference is what gives JIT-kanban systems their unique characteristics. This paper investigates some of these unique characteristics of JIT-kanban systems by way of a dynamic simulation model. Using system-dynamic concepts, the behaviour of the system under the stimulus of various exogeneous factors is demonstrated. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An experimental ECM unit, and a relocation fixture-cum machining set-up were used to study the effect of machining parameters on surface modifications in ECM. Studies on vee and trapezoidal shaped profiles showed that they smooth out to a sinusoidal profile before attaining the final shape and that at higher currents less time is required for producing the sinusoidal wave form.

"Drastic changes in market demands and rapid technological development have created a need for more flexible production systems and more complex products with a larger degree of variation. There is strong pressure towards the use of more and more mechanized and automated equipment, from single NC-machines to complete manufacturing systems. At the same time, there is a need for flexibility towards changes in the products. These changes have to be made in a limited time, and without the need for large reinvestments in the production system. This means that more often there must be discussion regarding flexibility versus productivity before the production system is designed. T will discuss methods for calculation of different flexibility levels, strategies for a more flexible view upon products and processes, and examples and results from different areas within the Swedish industry. © 1984 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Two types of heuristic capacity-control policies are evaluated using a simulation model of a materials-requirements-planning production system. The control- policy decisions are based solely on the size of the queue, as measured in standard hours of work, at each work centre in the production system. Several classes of product mixes and product structures and several levels of the control parameters of each policy, are investigated. The results indicate that each control policy gives rise to a unique population of weekly labour, work in process and intermediate inventory level. Product structure is identified as a major variable in materials- requirements-planning systems performance. Sensitivity analysis of the cost functions for each policy indicates the conditions under which it will minimize the sum of labour costs, work-in-process holding costs and inventory holding costs. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A probabilistic approach to the development of a simplified work measurement system is presented. As a result of this approach, expected time values and accompanying variances can be calculated for each element under investigation. General Purpose Date (GPD) and Master Standard Data (MSD), standard data systems which are simplifications of a more detailed predetermined time system, Methods-Time Measurement (MTM), were used to illustrate the applicability of this method. In order to pursue this probabilistic approach, the various combinations of MTM elements which satisfy each investigated GPD and MSD element have been enumerated. The probability of occurrence of each of these possible combinations has been developed using historical data. Given the time value and the probability of occurrence for each possible combination, the expected time value and accompanying variances were generated for the “simplified” element. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1965,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enormous improvements are possible by synchronizing manufacturing tasks sequentially within a short lead time and by creating cycle times by which many different kinds of work can be fitted together like clockwork. Actually achieving close synchronization requires utmost effort to improve every aspect of a manufacturing organization.

"This paper compares the effectiveness of three strategies for reducing part use variability in an assembly plant: decreasing the total number of part options. building parts, to-order, and reducing travel time variability. Each of these strategies can reduce the inventory needed to protect against running out of material at the plant. They allow inventory banks to be reduced, and reduce the likelihood of material stock-outs. A general model for evaluating the impact of the three strategies on inventory and transportation cost is developed. Interpreting this model resulted in the following conclusions: Reducing the total number of part options and building to-order are most effective at reducing part use variability when there are many options and when travel time is reliable. Shifting from common carrier to contract carrier is most effective when there are few options or when parts are built to-order. The effectiveness of building to-order and contract carriers is increased when the strategies are implemented together. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A work force pianning model is developed for minimizing the costs of standard wages, over-time wages, hiring and firing. The optimal work-force size and hiring/firing plan are found by plotting a labour requirement curve and calculating the change in cost due to infinitesimal changes in work-force size. Simple optimality criteria are derived by determining when the change in cost equals zero. Based on the model’s assumptions, the following planning principles are identified: (1) Over-time and under-time should only be used during periods when the work-force size is not changing. (2) If work-force size is kept constant, the proportion of time in which overtime is used should equal I IP, where P is the ratio of the over-time wage rate to the standard wage rate. (3) Cost changes gradually when the work-force size is either made larger or smaller than the optimum. Therefore, a wide range of work-force sizes yields costs that are close to the optimum. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The paper shows how the governing equations are modified by allowing a variation in yield stress throughout a deformation zone. The limitations imposed by these equations are discussed and a method is proposed to illustrate the effect of variable yield stress on the deformation pattern. From the study of a particular solution of plane strain extrusion, it is concluded that variation in yield stress should not markedly change the pattern of deformation from that appropriate to a non-hardening situation. This conclusion, therefore, gives support for the mean strain solution currently employed to accommodate strain hardening, particularly if this method is applied incrementally along the streamlines. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1967,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A method is proposed which provides the force for a given axi-symmetric plastic deformation process. The method is based on equilibrium considerations of the stress system arising from a kinematically admissible system of velocity discontinuities. The circumferential stress is denned by the Haar and von Kármán assumption. This assumed pattern of velocity discontinuities is adjusted to give a minimum value of applied force. The method is considered in the context of the extrusion process and is shown to agree with an alternative upper bound solution, both solutions being in reasonable agreement with experimental results. By a comprehensive evaluation of the extrusion loads for various reductions, frictional conditions and cone angles, the method may be used to predict the formation of dead zones. Experimental results for the extrusion through lubricated 90° dies show reasonable agreement with such predictions. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1965,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Research into alternate routings suggests that basing process plans solely on machine and expected batch characteristics may be ignoring two important elements. (1) As actual batch quantities vary from their expected values, the balance between fixed and variable process components sometimes shifts, causing different machines to exhibit lower total processing costs. (2) As the most cost-effective machines become disproportionately loaded, the efficiency of the system may be served by considering alternative machines that are more generally available. The focus of this study is to investigate the significance of considering actual process quantity and relative resource availability under common conditions. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In determining inspection plans for quality control, two important variables are the frequency of sampling and the sample size. Typical values are once per hour, with a sample of size 4 or 5.

"In the research area of FMS, much past work has concentrated upon unique systems analysing production control strategies. In some cases, no physical system was available as reference, necessitating a variety of system assumptions by researchers. It has been very difficult to compare control strategy effectiveness among applications or among researchers due to many different system assumptions and a general lack of standardization among system definitions.

"Two approaches to condition monitoring are presented which use a parallel model representation of the equipment being observed. One displays, in a user friendly manner, deviations from normal operating conditions; thus enabling the operator to make informed adjustments to the plant. Trends in the system's behaviour can be followed by noting the periodic changes required to the model to re-align the outputs. The other approach allows for the inaccuracies in the system's model by the use of a ‘tracking rate analysis’. Given that the model will have to be reset from time to time, effective condition monitoring is possible by noting a change in the rate of resetting which, under certain safeguards, will be due to system change. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, tool design in ECM is still a problem which delays the use of this process. This paper has focused attention on some of the problems that should be studied before it would be possible to obtain an analytical design of toolings for ECM. Non-uniform electrolyte distribution, different electrolyte flow path lengths and variations in current density have been found to be the main features that characterize the nature of the elliptical hole shape by ECM. The resistance model technique has been applied for the analysis of the elliptical hole shape. A parametric study of the process which highlights certain guidelines for ECM tooling designer is also presented. Experimental results have revealed significant variations in the resultant side gap length at major and minor diameters of the tool.

"We introduce the concept of artificial intelligence and its possible contribution towards the human-robot interface by considering the conceptual support such an idealized interface might provide. In following this argument we see that integration of the various aspects of a product's life cycle is a convenient way of introducing the information and knowledge required for an artificially intelligent interface. The information is produced as a result of the earlier processes and lost in most conventional systems. We conclude that the knowledge of the task the robot is to perform is available not as an afterthought which would require manual input to the robot after the product has been designed but as part of a factory-wide integrated system concerned with the whole product life cycle. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An adaptive control system is proposed in which a given amount of tool wear is allowed per operation. The objective of the control system is to machine a certain feed distance in the minimum tune using no more than the wear allowed and working within the conventional adaptive control constraints. The average rate at which the operation progresses can thus be regulated by appropriately setting the wear target. The adaptive control system has been applied to the control of a lathe performing a simple bar turning operation. An on-line computer receives transducer responses, calculates and issues feed and speed corrections. The optimization policy requires the tool wear rate to be estimated while cutting and in this work the estimation was made from the cutting process variables including the tool-work thermocouple voltage. Workpiece disturbances in the form of hardness changes were introduced and the experimental responses of the control system to these disturbances are presented. The success of estimating wear rate on a sample of the controlled tests is also presented. © 1977, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A three parameter time constant learning curve model is applied to four case studies and the optimum parameters determined in the least sum of error-squared sense. The error residuals are then analysed using correlation, regression, and cusum techniques. A global range for learning curve scatter is derived from grouped data. One case study establishes a sinusoidal trend additional to wide-band noise. In all cases studied there is correlation between successive error residuals so that there are many less sign changes than predicted from an assumption of normally distributed, uncorrelated scatter. A simulation model is documented which generates artificial learning curves with the requisite degree of correlation as evident in terms of the number of sign changes. The results of the paper may be used to establish the a priori scatter estimates necessary in various parameter estimation techniques developed for on-line prediction of human operator future performance. © 1975, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1975,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A flexible manufacturing cell (FMC) has become of major interest recently as a new machining unit for low-volume, variety production. However, set-up operations for workpieces have not yet been automated in the usual FMC. In this paper, the design and scheduling problems for FMC with automatic set-up equipment are discussed. The FMC consists of a machining centre, an industrial robot, a loading-unloading station and an index-pallet changer. First, the design and control system of the FMC is explained. Then a scheduling algorithm is developed to achieve the minimum total production time in order to operate the FMC effectively. As this FMC has finite buffer spaces on the index-pallet changer, this model can be regarded as a two-machine flow-shop problem with finite buffer spaces. Next, an algorithm for determining the optimum number of buffer spaces is constructed to design the FMC using the results of scheduling. Finally, a numerical example is given for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Material requirements planning (MRP) systems have become a dominant method in production scheduling and inventory control over the last decade. An MRP is a very complicated information system. It needs to be updated frequently in order to reflect unplanned events, such as machine breakdowns, that exist within or outside the production system. However, the resultant frequent disruption of open orders is a major operational problem of MRP systems, which is generally referred to as ‘system nervousness’. MRP system nervousness is caused by various operating variables and environmental factors. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of operating environments, external or internal, on MRP system nervousness. Several studies have addressed the effectiveness of alternative strategies for reducing MRP system nervousness in a number of operating environments. In this study, a factory simulation is used as an experimental vehicle to investigate the impact on M R P system nervousness of various factors, such as the tightness of capacity utilization and the lot-sizing algorithm used. Based on this study, a set of guidelines is presented which allow MRP users to select an appropriate dampening strategy to cope with system nervousness in face of their operating environments. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A group of twenty volunteers from difficult production jobs was used to evaluate the hypotheses that (1) the physiological strain resulting from production floor stress will be high, (2) production floor strain can be predicted from apparatus tests and (3) production floor strain will adversely affect performance. Each subject had his heart rate and respiration rate measured as he performed a sot of apparatus tests in a laboratory and as he performed his job on the production floor. The psychological stress and the resulting physiological strain were found to be low for experienced production workers. The apparatus test failed to predict production floor strain because of the discrepancy between the stress levels in the laboratory and on the production floor. The low stress levels on the production floor made it difficult to evaluate the effect of stress on performance, however, there was evidence that stress does affect performance. © 1971 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Past research on the lot size scheduling problem has relied heavily on the following assumptions: (1)Each product is to be produced on a regular invariant cycle. (2)The inventory level at the onset of each production run is zero. In this paper these two restrictions have been dropped. It is shown that the inventory cost function can be expressed as a linear function. This allows the use of linear programming methods to determine the optimal lengths for a given sequence of production runs. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.,1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Although many articles have been published on the general priority scheduling problem, very few have been concerned with directly minimizing costs. The few studies which do consider overall costs do not use these costs in establishing a job's priority in the queue. This paper investigates how the time and cost performance of jobs are affected by the use of a rule which directly considers costs. A simulation model of a hypothetical job shop is used to examine several of these cost rules, as well as some common rules concerned with the timeliness of jobs. Performance measures include both time-oriented and cost-oriented measures. The results indicate that rules which directly consider costs (or profit) may prove practical for a manager where minimization of WTP and maximization of ROT are the primary and secondary objectives of the company. © 1983 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In this paper two mathematical models are developed for an inventory system in which the units are deteriorating at a constant rate and the demand rate decreases negative exponentially. In the first model it is assumed that replenishment orders are placed at equal intervals while in the second model the replenishment times are also variables and hence there is no need for the replenishment orders to be placed at equal intervals. Optimal replenishment policies are determined for both cases. A numerical example is used to illustrate the theory. Computational results indicate that the constant replenishment period policy leads to a higher total cost. © 1983 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Many manufacturing systems require an assignment of machines to locations along a straight track, so as to optimize material flow. This paper uses a cut approach to the corresponding quadratic assignment problem, and derives a heuristic which generates a good solution. In addition, a modified lower bound to the assignment problem is also developed, which is always better than the classical lower bound. Results showing the performance of the heuristic are demonstrated, along with a comparison of the modified and classical lower bound. In almost all the test problems, the solution generated by the heuristic was either optimal or better than any solution obtained by other methods.

"This paper interrelates and synthesizes the economic design of quality and process control policy and the management of a production system described in terms of an M/G/X queue. A mathematical model is developed to determine the optimal quality and process control policy when both the quality and quantity issues in the production system are considered. The optimal control policy is defined as the one that maximizes the expected profit per unit time over an infinite horizon. Hypothetical data is used to illustrate the impact of on-line control policies on the operating characteristics of the production process. For a given control policy, it is shown that the expected profit per unit time of the production system can be increased by either improving the reliability of the production system, increasing the arrival rate of incoming jobs, increasing the system's processing rate, or shortening the system's shutdown time. The results also indicate that the larger the performance difference between the in-control and the out-of-control states, the greater the amount of effort should be involved in quality and process control. Finally, it is important for the capacity design of a production system to take into account the requirrments for both quality control and process adjustment. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper reports on research conducted on the use of priority dispatching rules in a hybrid assembly/job shop which manufactures both single-component and multiple-component products. A simulation model was constructed and a large stale experiment performed. Statistical analysis of the simulation results indicated significant impact of both the priority rules tested, and the product-mix considered on shop performance. Among the 12 priority rules tested, the SPT (shortest processing time) rule and the ASMF-SPT (assembly jobs first with SPT as tie-breaker) rule performed very well with respect to measures like lateness, flow time, tardiness, staging time, and percent of jobs tardy. These findings lead to further investigation of a combined priority rule, MIXED, which implements the ASMF-SPT rule at all machine centres that process components of assembly jobs, and the SPT rule at the remaining machine centres which process non-component jobs. The additional research results yielded evidence that the MIXED rule can reduce the staging time of the SPT rule, and yielded betrer results than the ASMF-SPT rule with regard to other performance measures. The most interesting finding, however, was the small variation in flow time distribution resulting from use of the MIXED rule when there were more assembly jobs. In an MRP environment, it is especially desirable to have a priority dispatching rule resulting in minimum variation in individual flow times which allows the replenishment lead times to be estimated with greater accuracy. © 1984 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The cost of component production is strongly influenced by a range of management decisions. For example, which machine should be used?; How many should be made?; What quantity should be held in stores? In a recessionary climate, these questions usually result in a decision to reduce work-in-progress (WIP) by processing smaller batches. However, such a strategy inevitably increases other costs, for example, handling and setting costs. Conversely, the necessity for frequent design changes increases the likelihood of stock becoming obsolete, further strengthening the case for reducing batch sizes. To alleviate the above problems, and achieve a quantifiable answer to the question, ‘Which type of machine should be used?’ and ‘What should be the batch quantity?’. a computer-based, multi-variable costing model has been established. For a defined component, or class of component, the model developed selects the appropriate machine tool and batch size, the selection procedure being based on an analysis of costs Additional uses for the model include the evaluation of the cost, of component manufacture, on a specified machine, for batches of varying size, or the simulation of various production situations so that management can assess the sensitivity of cost to process changes. Two examples of the use of the model are provided to illustrate its range of application. Both are taken from actual production situations. In the first example the model is being used by company management to evaluate a major investment programme for the purchase of advanced machine tools. As part of this evaluation the model is used to compare the cost of producing a component on a CNC turning centre as opposed to the use of a combination of less sophisticated machines. In the second example the model is used to select the most suitable machine, from four competing types, to produce a particular component. In this example, different production situations are investigated to illustrate the model's value as a simulation tool. © 1983 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition (for a certain type of problem), a standard textbook proposition about nondelay sampling was found not to hold true. The research also adds insights into active schedule algorithms.

"This paper is concerned with the optimal production planning and inventory control. The first problem is a multiperiod production scheduling problem in which the objective is to minimize the operating cost for a planning period. This cost is composed principally of the sum of the production cost and inventory carrying cost. The second problem considers an inventory system with two decision variables in each planning period. These are the production schedule and work force which are to be determined so as to minimize the operating cost which includes the costs of changing the production rate, of changing the work force and of carrying the inventory. The maximum principle in the discrete form is used to reduce both the first problem which has N decision variables and the second problem which has 2N decision variables respectively to a series of two decision variables problems. The so-called sequential simplex pattern search technique is used to determine the optimal values of these two decision variables.

"This paper reports the findings of a survey of 53 US users of group technology (GT). Respondent installations were medium to large electronics and metalworking manufacturers. They engaged predominantly in fabrication activities, producing a large number of component parts and/or end items. These firms applied GT to design, process planning (including NC programming), sales, purchasing, cost estimation, tooling, scheduling, new equipment sizing, and tool selection. In the majority of cases, firms used classification and coding systems as tools in applying GT. While users identified managerial and technical barriers which must be overcome in successfully applying GT, significant and varied operational and strategic benefits had been achieved. Further, most felt that GT would be an integral and important part of future CAD/CAM activities at their plant. The respondents' experiences confirm that GT's usefulness is quite broad and suggest that failure to understand GT as a general philosophy and, instead, to consider it a tool or equate it with a specific use, may result in lost opportunities to improve manufacturing productivity.

"A technique is presented to assist in the scheduling of projects given uncertainties (i.e. tolerances) on the durations of activities in the project. A Monte Carlo analysis is carried out in the tolerance region of activity durations and performance functions of interest such as the mean and variance of project duration and probability-weighted critical paths are evaluated. The proposed technique has a number of advantages. First, it handles the situation where activities are not independent. Second, in deducing variations in project duration, account is taken of all toleranced activities in the project. This is in contrast to existing methods which take account only of activities on the critical path. Third, the technique not only identifies critical paths, but also estimates the probability that those paths remain critical given the tolerance variations in the project. By virtue of the statistical sampling approach, computational cost of the technique is independent of project complexity. Application of the technique is a vital pre-requisite for optimal project scheduling, moreover, preliminary studies have shown that valuable sensitivity information regarding project duration and critical paths can be obtained. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The SUMT algorithm of Fiaccoand McCormick (1968) is a powerful technique for the optimization of a multivariable, nonlinear function subject to both linear and nonlinear constraints. It has been used to solve optimization problems in many situations, but not very successfully in batch production problems. This is largely because, as with most algorithms using gradient search methods, SUMT does not cope very well with nonsmooth, discontinuous functions that are common in batch production.

"In some flexible manufacturing systems, group technology principles divide parts naturally into groups so that substantial set-ups occur only when switching production between groups. We discuss the scheduling of one such real-life manufacturing process. We develop a practical heuristic for the economic lot scheduling problem in this group technology environment. The heuristic is relatively simple, yet performs well. An example is solved in detail. A computational study verifies the heuristic's capabilities and suggests extensions for improvement. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A tolerance chart is a graphical representation of a process plan and a manual procedure for controlling tolerance stackup when the machining of a component involves interdependent tolerance chains. This heuristic, experience-based method of allocating tolerances to individual cuts of a process plan can be embodied in a computer-based module. This paper introduces a graph theoretic representation for the tolerance chart. A special path tracing algorithm is used to identify tolerance chains from this graph. Optimal tolerance allocation among individual cuts is achieved using a linear goal programming model instead of existing heuristic methods. A more comprehensive mixed integer programming model is developed to incorporate linear tolerance cost functions and alternative process selection. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this paper important issues in the automatic generation of process plans are addressed. Since the conventional method of electronic assembly planning is subjective and depends greatly on the skills, memory, knowledge, and experience of the planners, inconsistencies in the plan arise, which in turn create problems in the manufacturing environment. An automatic electronic assembly planning system that would offer advantages over manual systems has been implemented. Due to frequent advances in technology, the electronic industry is a very dynamic one. This affects the effectiveness of the current process plans and the applicability of the system that generates them. The framework of a system which takes into account the dynamic nature of the environment is presented as an example. A network representation of plans that allows for flexibility and modularity in the planning system is being used. A hybrid architecture consisting of production rules, procedural algorithms and a hierarchical database has been implemented using an expert system shell. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two types of the component (precast concrete panels) are msnufactuwd; a stnndard metnl form for standard components, and a special metal form for the special components requid by each indiridual customer. While the standard forms can be produced beforehand and used for many different projeots, the special forms are customized-madc-toorder- fir each particular project and cannot be prodund until the order for that project ha* been received. Generally, then; manufacturing policy is determined by the average due of standard ratioa, that is, the pn, partion of standard components out of the total number of components of each order. In this system, the number of standard forms can be ascertained from totd demand and the standard ratio. However. the number of stnndard forn-s determined by this method might precipitate supply into 8 shortage on demand and change the lead time. This is due to three types of fluctuations; arrival intervals, standard ratios and special form processing tlmes. In this paper, mixed huffer production Rystems are proposed in order to decreaw the shortage of components and the sh-ppingle ad time, hoth of which could he affected by the three types of fluctuation mentioned above. With this in mind. it is hoped that the several numerical examples show that mixed huffer production rystems are more effective than a single buffer production system. © 1985 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"When similar products are mix-produced through manufacturing operations where some of the processes are in common and some are different, split automatic transfer lines are installed. In these lines, a split interference caused by a split of the in-process job flow occurs, and line productivity decreases more than series lines. So buffer storages need to be allocated between successive stages. In this paper we study the behaviour of split lines using a Markov model, and compare two allocation methods for the buffer: one is the allocation of local buffers and the other is the allocation of a common buffer. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The future-oriented concept of computer-integrated, flexibly automated manufacture reveals the first convincing results at present. They indicate a fundamental change of production modes. Due to the transition from order-neutral manufacture to manufacture bound by order, targets are developing that have to be met by flexible solutions of process automation of a new type. Finally, in order to achieve high flexibility of manufacture, monitoring and control strategies of a new type have to be developed. Tool monitoring is the focus of process monitoring. This will be shown by raised technological machine intelligence of flexible automated turning cells with the main components of sensor systems, control concept and process models for monitoring and control strategies. The process invariance to be aimed at for process monitoring now involves the development of such strategies applicable for a maximum value range of a maximum number of process, tool and machine tool parameters. For adaptive control systems at machining cells, the actual available machining time mentioned has to be included into the technological process model as a basis for self-optimization. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In order to gain better understanding of the effect of pre-aging on the tensile properties of 6201 Al alloy, different TAHA processes have been performed in this study. A 6201 AI alloy was first solution treated, followed by pre-aging at 135°C for 30 minutes (some specimens were without pre-aging). The specimens were then cold rolled to 60, 70 or 80% reduction in thickness followed by final aging at 140, 150 or 160°C for 1 to 20 hours. For specimens of 60% cold reduction, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS) were significantly improved by pre-aging. The improvement in strengths by pre-aging was most (least) significant if the final aging temperature was 140°C (160°C). For specimens of 70% reduction, the improvement in UTS and YS by pre-aging was not as significant. For specimens of 80% cold reduction, lower strengths were found for pre-aged specimens as compared to specimens without pre-aging. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that there was close relationship between the fracture morphology and the resulting tensile properties. Proper combination of pre-aging and cold work led to finer, denser and more uniform distribution of precipitates which resulted in better tensile properties. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The paper deals with a version of the general non-permutation flow-shop scheduling problem in which the duration of each operation on certain machines is a linear function of the allotted part of a constrained resource (e.g. energy, fuel, catalyzer, oxygen, raw material, money) and the objective is to determine both a sequence of the operations on each machine and an allocation of resource to each operation in order to minimize the over-all completion time. The algorithm for solving this problem is based on the disjunctive graph theory and branch and bound technique. Due to the present elimination properties, the search tree is strongly restricted. It applies a special system of fixing precedence relations in each node of the search tree yielding strong lower and upper bounds. To quickly obtain a strong upper bound a special heuristic method is used (to calculate a good initial solution) and the descendants in the search tree are chosen in order of the non-decreasing lower bounds. Some computational results and concluding remarks are included as well. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Electron microprobe analysis for the surface deposition and diffusion of tool material was carried out on mild steel (MS), high-carbon steel (HCS) and high-speed steel (HSS) work samples, machined by an electrical discharge process using a relaxation circuit in distilled water and kerosene at 225 and 56·25 mJ pulse energy, with copper and brass as tools. It was observed that high-energy machining results in lower surface deposition but more depth of diffusion. MS-HCS-HSS showed increasing surface deposition but decreasing depth of diffusion in the same order. Machining in distilled water at high-pulse energy resulted in lower surface deposition and depth of diffusion as compared to machining in kerosene. At low-pulse energy kerosene showed similar results. Tool material was found to deposit preferentially along the crater rims. The possibility of a certain typical geometry of crater formation in multi-spark machining is concluded.

"A large percentage of back injuries experienced by industrial workers is the result of performing manual materials handling tasks (MMH). Therefore, manual materials handling jobs should be designed to eliminate, or to minimize, worker risk. Based on the information available in the literature, a set of MMH capacity models has been developed to accommodate: (1) various types of tasks, such as lifting, lowering, carrying, pushing, and pulling, and (2) important MMH task parameters, such as frequency of handling, height/distance of handling, box sizes, and presence/absence of handles. The models can also be adjusted for work (shift) duration, body twist, and different population percentiles. Following the development of these models, a comprehensive job design/redesign procedure was developed. A ‘risk potential’ index was also constructed to evaluate the acceptance/rejection of each task element.

"This research utilized a biomechanical approach for the investigation of body weight effects in a manual-lifting activity. Following a 3-day training session, 10 male subjects performed 6 tasks in 12 trials. For each trial, the subject was directed to use a free style posture to lift a weighted box from the floor to a 0.762m high shelf. In order to evaluate the forces and torques generated by the external load and the body weight acting on the articulations and vertebra during the lifting task, the experimenter used a high-speed camera to record the lifting activity, a GP-8 Sonic Digitizer to translate the motion into coordinates, and a biomechanical program to calculate the forces acting on the L5/S1 disc, the maximum abdominal force,and the torque acting on the abdomen. After the statistical analysis, two regression models were developed, which provide a convenient and useful means to quantify the maximum compressive and shear forces acting on the low back area during a sagittal plane-lifting activity. The model for the maximum compressive force acting on the L5/S1 disc in kilograms accounted for 95% of the variability in observed data (R2 = 0.9506); the model for the maximum shear force acting on the same disc in kilograms accounted for 93% of the variability in observed data (R2 = 0.9269). © 1988 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Inventory models which permit coordinated control (or joint replenishment) of families of items are of considerable interest in practice. A major complexity in coordinated control is that, typically, one item triggers the family order and the other items have stock remaining above their reorder points. Account should be taken of this so-called residual stock when establishing the reorder points. In this paper, modelling the inventory position as a diffusion process permits us to develop expressions for the components of the residual stock probability density functions. Heuristics are presented for quick calculation of these expressions. Then we show how residual stock is taken into account in determining the reorder points of the individual items. The relationship of these residual stock pdf expressions to other components in a new class of coordinated control models is also discussed.

Solutions could be found for 40-task problems if the average number of tasks per station was no more than four. For the 20-task problems, branch and bound algorithms performed the best for problems with four or more tasks per station, while a particular dynamic programming formulation performed best on problems with an average of two tasks per station.

"This paper describes a scheduling algorithm used to suggest the sequence in which new products should be started on circuit pack assembly lines. For a real application many aspects, such as inaccuracy of data, incomplete information, variability and unpredictability of many events, etc., make it very difficult to have a realistic model which is analytically tractable. The scheduling approach developed here is an effort to capture the right details and to leave an allowance for the aspects not represented in the model. It shifts the emphasis from optimization with’ idealistic models to a conservative approach with more realistic models. A combination of heuristics are used to achieve the objectives of meeting weekly due dates, of keeping W1P, flow time and number of set-ups low while maintaining capacity. Due dates are given the highest priority. Within the limitations imposed by due dates, a weighted, cumulative load imbalance measure is used to balance the load on all operations. Set-up considerations determine the choice if this measure is close to (say, within 15% of) the minimum. This provides a simple, robust and reasonably sound solution to an enormously difficult problem. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The paper describes two fast iterative algorithms for estimating the capacity of automated production lines with finite buffers. These algorithms are based on the linear programming formulation of the problem developed earlier by the author, and provide a range of values in which the throughput of the line is expected to lie. The throughput estimates of the two algorithms, compared with an estimate based on a simple workload analysis, indicate the amount of blocking/starvation as well as the probable causes of this unproductive time. The paper illustrates how inferences can be drawn from the two algorithms and used to improve the loading sequence and lot sizes. Managers can decide if the potential for improvement, which would be to get rid of all blocking/starvation, justifies the time to be spent on such an effort. New alternatives can be developed based on the insights provided by the algorithms and tested quickly. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper considers a highly automated manufacturing line which consists of a sequence of workstations. Relatively small buffers are assigned between workstations in order to guarantee a small manufacturing interval and quick feedback in the event of process failure to make acceptable product. These small buffers could lead to a noticeable loss of line capacity due to the phenomenon of blocking and starvation. We show by means of simple examples how the buffer sizes and the mix and loading sequence of different types of jobs could significantly affect the production rate of the line. A linear programming based method is then developed to estimate the line capacity for a given configuration of machines and buffers sizes and for a given job mix and sequence. This method also gives the expected machine utilizations, the time machines are blocked/starved and, more importantly, the reason for this lost production capacity. By judiciously interpreting this information, one or more of the following steps can be taken to improve the production rate: (a) change the loading sequence, (b) increase the buffer space selectively, (c) make the products in smaller or larger batches, and (d) add new machines. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A multi-echeleon inventory system with one central warehouse and n regional warehouses is considered. Customer demand is satisfied from the regional warehouses. A push type control system is used, implying that the allocation of stock is coordinated by the central unit. Given an initial system stock, a fixed planning horizon and two shipping possibilities from the central warehouse until the next system replenishment, the problem of deciding how much to ship initially to each warehouse is addressed. The stock retained at the central warehouse will be allocated to the branches at the second shipping opportunity so as to, if possible, balance the inventory levels, thus maximizing the customer service until the time of the next replenishment. An approximation of the multi-variate probability distribution of the inventory levels at the regional warehouses, after the second shipping opportunity, is presented. Given a desired customer service level, the optimal initial system stock and the associated allocation are derived on the basis of this approximation. Characteristics of the optimal solution are discussed. The performance is compared with a simple ship-all policy, and with an extreme policy allowing a complete redistribution of the inventory among the regional warehouses at the second shipping opportunity. The results show that significant benefits can be achieved by the retention of some stock at the central warehouse. © 1987 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques provide various tools for use in the development of automated process planning systems. AI can be utilized for automated reasoning about the shape, features and relationship between features and for development of expert systems for creating the process plan itself. Most of the previous work on AI in process planning deals with one specific application. This paper presents an integrated hierarchical framework of a process planning system with a CAD interface. The objective of the project discussed in the paper is to integrate design with process planning using AI techniques. The development of a CAD interface is discussed with respect to automated feature recognition, determination of tool approach direction and deciding the precedence relationship between the features. Sample results from the CAD interface are presented. The expert system for the process planning module is discussed with the part representation and knowledge base and the plan generation procedure. The module uses hierarchically organized frames for both part representation and the knowledge base.

"The new method of estimating the Limiting Drawing Ratio (L.D.R.) in deep-drawing makes use of oversize blanks with standard diameters. Experimental results indicate that the bulge depth at fracture, to blank diameter curves for oversize blanks can be expressed by a particular type of an exponential expression. To evaluate the parameters in the equation, three tests until fracture, using three different oversize blanks are necessary. The bulge depth and blank diameter data are then used in the solution of the three simultaneous equations. This calculation is best performed on a computer to obtain high accuracy. Thus the limiting blank size and L.D.R. can be calculated The calculated results compared very favourably with the experimental ones, and they were generally the same within one increment of L.D.R. Experiments were conducted on ferrous and non-ferrous materials using a hemispherical punch Since blanks produced by standard size punching tools can be used, this method saves time and effort. The method can also be applied to non-symmetrical components, provided that geometrical similarity between the oversize blanks is maintained. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this paper we treat the optimum ordering policy, in which when an ordered spare is delivered, it can be put into inventory until a prespecified time if the original unit is still operating. We apply the expected total discounted cost as a criterion of optimality, introducing, with an exponential discount rate, two types of lead times and several costs. It is shown that under certain conditions there exist optimum ordering policies minimizing that expected cost. Finally, the results in this paper include those in an earlier paper by Kaio and Osaki (1978) as special cases. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We consider a planned maintenance policy of providing identical spares successively for replacement of a failed unit as corrective maintenance or a non-failed unit as preventive maintenance. We assume that an identical spare is provided by order with a lead time. Then we consider when we should order an identical spare to minimize the expected cost per unit time in the steady state. In particular, we take into account the salvage cost for the non-failed unit. We show that there exists an optimum ordering policy under certain conditions. © 1978, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1978,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A major hurdle in the development of intelligent robots is that we still do not possess efficient computational and representational methodologies for emulating knowledge and expectation driven behaviour so basic to human cognition and problem solving. Even if we use techniques such as geometric modelling for representing objects in the robot world, we are still lacking in methods for linking such representations with sensory feedback. In this paper, we have proposed the use of intermediate representations—we call them sensor-tuned representations—for linking CSG based solid modelling with sensory information. We also discuss how sensor-tuned representations are constructed from range data and how object recognition can be done with sensor-tuned representations. Finally, we show results of manipulation experiments produced by the current implementation of the system. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The author gives a view of the present methods for evaluation of cutting fluids and emphasizes that reliable selection can be made by means of cutting processes, exclusively. Regarding their time-consuming and rather expensive nature the necessity arises to develop short-run tests. He describes two short-run tests introduced in Hungary and proves their efficiency on the basis of experiments. One of these tests is used in the low-speed range and leads to the cutting force reducing the effect of the fluid; the other is applied in the speed range v > 20 m/min reflecting the complex friction reducing effect. The latter test can be expressed in the Taylor equation. © 1971, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Regression analysis applied to the time series productivity data of 114 assembly workers in an electronics firm, covering a period of 152 weeks, suggests that time-dependent individual productivity changes in the post-learning or ‘drift’ phase can be adequately represented with a quadratic time series model. Some 70% of the operators studied are shown to have a maximum shaped curve, so that the long-term drift in production level is downward and thought to be due to a decline in effort. The methodology used suggests that long-term trends of individual operator performance can be readily predicted from work records, thus highlighting the need for job redesign and other motivational aids. The results presented here also provide some support for the hypothesis that the particular form of this model is indicative of the dominant influence of antecedent changes in work attitudes. © 1979, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In most economic lot size models, the demand during stockout period is either completely backordered, or lost. Also, the quantity received is assumed to be the same as the quantity ordered. In this paper, a lot size model is described in which the demand during stockout period is either completely or partially backordered, and also the quantity received is uncertain. The standard deviation of the quantity received is taken to be independent of, or proportional to, the quantity ordered. In both cases, the results obtained are shown to be extensions of the well known results of the simple lot size model with backordering. © 1982 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Decision-making on lay-out demands consideration of numerous criteria. This paper considers the most important of them and divides them into three groups: limiting, mutually influencing and marginal conditions. Because of the different criteria, we also need different approaches to the various problems. Many possible ways of solving lay-out problems are shown schematically. The main text illustrates two algorithms: decision-making on lay-out of the arrangement of new production systems, and changing existing lay-outs. Each states a procedure leading to the best solution. Although materials flow will be the most important decision-making factor, the changing nature of working life demands the inclusion of other factors and conditions. Mathematical algorithms and the use of computers to this end can only aid the decision-making procedure to a limited extent. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The authors compare two well-known methods for setting manufacturing lead times (flow allowances) in a general job shop when early shipment of completed jobs is forbidden. One of the methods for setting a job's allowance is to make it proportional to the total processing time for the job. This method, referred to as TWK., is compared to a second method PPW. With the PPW method, a job's allowance is obtained by adding to the total job-processing time an allowance for waiting that is proportional to the number of operations that the job requires. The two allowance methods are compared using a computer simulation of an 8-machine job shop. The model is unique in that jobs are not permitted to leave the shop early. This feature of forbidding early shipment (FES) complicates the comparison between allowance methods because it draws the issue of finished-order inventory management into the analysis. Results of computer simulations over a wide range of average due-date difficulty suggest that TWK is the dominant procedure by virtue of providing both tower tardiness and lower inventory. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The central problem of manufacturing planning is to reconcile clue dates, derived from customer delivery timetables, with schedule dates, developed from production capabilities. Conventional capacity planning techniques utilize the technological sequencing of material flow in order to build up production schedules. As they ignore interactions between work stations, and override due date requirements, these techniques are often unsatisfactory. Wight and Belt have suggested a new approach to the problem, and this paper presents a systematic methodology based on their ideas, to characterize and analyse the flow of work through a work station, and relate this flow to the nominal capacity of the station. Operation of the station is measured by work in process, delay and underload (operation below nominal capacity); flow between stations is measured by queue length and lead times (process plus wait time). Performance is evaluated by the degree of underload and overload planned for the station—the degree to which available capacity is utilized, and the degree to which lead times, imposed by the Material Requirements Plan, can be achieved. Achievable average and maximum lead times are shown to be a function of both nominal work station capacity and the input work load profile—not a constant value for the work station. A more correct study of plannable lead times, as production loads vary, allows the necessary connection to be made between due dates and schedule dates. © 1982 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The How of work through a work station is analysed in terms of planned input from previous stations, planned output to subsequent stations, planned work-in- process waiting for processing, and the planned queue of unprocessed work delayed for processing during some subsequent period. The planner is assumed to have some leeway in determining the maximum*throughput during each period— the planned capacity—and is thus interested in determining the optimal capacity, to be maintained at some constant value throughout the planning horizon. This paper presents a methodology for finding the optimal planned capacity of a work station, which minimizes total costs over the planning horizon. These costs are of three types: costs of establishing and maintaining the capacity level; costs of work processing; and costs of holding up work in the queue owing to insufficient capacity at any period.Various constraints are considered when characterizing the operating environment of the work station: minimum and maximum permissible queue lengths, delays, work-in-process amounts, lead times, underloading and backlogging. It is shown that these restrictions may be transformed into minimum and maximum bounds on allowable capacity levels, so that the problem becomes one of constrained optimization in a single decision variable—the planned capacity. For complex cost functions or when underloading is permissible, complete enumeration of all feasible solutions provides the simplest approach. For linear or quadratic cost functions and no underloading, the shape and smoothness of the total cost curve indicates that set. of feasible capacities within which the optimal capacity lies. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Automatic transfer lines are playing an increasingly important role in production. As production rates and capital investment increase, the cost of line stoppages also increases. A line stoppage of an automatic transfer line occurs every time any of the machines stop, unless there is a sufficient buffer stock between each machine in the line. Thus there arises the question of how much buffer stock between each machine is required to optimize line operation in accordance with some criterion such as maximum output or minimum cost. This paper describes in the first, part, one such solution for the case of an automatic bottling plant in a brewery. As a bottling line is a prime example of an automatic transfer line, we believe that the method hero described can be applied to all similar problems.

"This paper introduces a model for efficient utilization of warehouse personnel in an inventory selection process. A simple mathematical model, based on a time study that can be applied to establishing standards for efficiency measurement of labour in a warehouse setting is presented. The problem of determining a standard to compute performance in an environment with variable workload is solved by using an adjustable standard for each particular assignment. Specifically the proposed model is designed to estimate the time required to complete a picking cycle. Three time components are considered; the lead time, travel time, and non-efficient time. The results of an empirical study are used to set the values of system parameters. The use of a computer system that can generate order lists is essential for an effective application of this methodology.

"A new active error compensatory method for on-line cutting control has been developed for reduction of the form errors in machining. This approach is a combination of in-process gauging and model active compensatory control. In this approach, there are two features of substantial importance: stochastic modelling and optimum forecasting. Through stochastic modelling, the cutting tool error motions can be represented by a simple model without the necessity of obtaining the complex cause-and-effect relationships between various errors and error sources, and more importantly, it is possible to account for both repeatable and non-repeatable parts of errors. Optimum forecasting is an important prerequisite for a rational control strategy, considering the inevitable time delay associate with sensing, computation and actuation. The proposed control method was implemented for the control of cylindricity in boring operations. Through the controller simulation based on experimental measurements, the improvement in cylindricity accuracy confirms the effectiveness of this proposed strategy. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actually, in Toyota, this pull system is operated mnnunlly by means of a kanban, a sort of card or tag. As an alternative to a kanban method, a periodic pull syslem (P P S) is developed as an operating policy of practising a Pull system. Due to the fact that, in a PPS, the manual information processing time of a kanban method is replaced with an instant on-line computerized processing, the material lend time is much ahorter than that of a kanban system.

We consider the job shop scheduling problems in which there are orders with sizes greater than one (therefore there are multiple identical jobs), and in which each operation can be processed on several machines (therefore there are alternative routeings for the operations). These characteristics of the problems impose special precedence relationships among operations.

"A key element of manufacturing planning and control involves the inter-functional coordination of various manufacturing requirements. This paper reports the results of a simulation experiment that compares alternative master production scheduling (MPS) procedures in an assemble-to-order environment. The MPS procedures are superbills and covering sets. For a given investment in safety stocks the managerial problem is how to construct the MPS in order to minimize the firm's delivery time pressures. The results of the simulation experiment strongly support the use of the superbill techniques over the covering set technique. Moreover, of the experimental factors that influence delivery time performance, the choice of master production scheduling technique has the largest effect. Demand variability has the next greatest effect on delivery time performance. The safely stock level has the third greatest effect and product commonality was fourth. Finally, the managerial implications of the results are discussed in detail. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsidiary behaviour appears to be a compensatory motion, the occurrence of which was related to a low level of worker's consciousness in the monotonous work. Subsidiary behaviour is considered an escape behaviour from monotony and is required as a stimulus which may relieve the feeling of monotony.

Consideration of production lines as a series of finite queues permits evaluating inefficiencies in terms of the queue capacity at each station; the mean servicing (or work) times at each station and their distribution; and the numbers of stations. A simple rationale and numerically valid predicting formula is developed by considering first, the whole class of balanced two station systems and secondly, the effect of numbers of work stations.

"In an attempt to simplify the application of work measurement data, the technique known as ‘time-slotting’, is used. Time-slotting consists of collecting data in a specified work area, dividing the whole time range into segments, or slots, and letting a single time, in each slot, represent the time standard of all of the jobs whose true standard times fall into the slot. This technique has been widely used in developing time standards for low repetitive tasks, such as in the area of maintenance, where research has been carried out on the behaviour of different methods of designing slotting scales. Nevertheless, there does not appear to be one generally accepted method of designing these time-slotting scales. In this paper the theory of time-slotting is considered in general terms. First the principal errors which may occur in time-slotting are delineated and then the ways in which two of these errors can be determined, a priori, are demonstrated. The effect of variables of the time-slotting scale upon each type of error is then discussed. The principles and equations evoked in the paper will provide the basis for the evaluation of time-slotting scales under many varying conditions. Furthermore, a means of separating component errors in computer simulation of time-slotting scales has been established. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The use of forced comparisons in job evaluation is examined analytically to demonstrate how such characteristics as non-linearity of ranking, inconsistency of individual judges ranking and non-commonality of judgements of committees can be used to advantage in establishing job values. The use of full factorial and Youden Square plans as the basis of evaluation is also examined. The mathematical equations for both approaches are developed and illustrated by a numerical example. Paired comparisons have been used extensively in the United Kingdom as the basis of job evaluation schemes. However, the statistical reasoning behind these schemes is not known by the users and proponents of the approach. The use of forced comparisons, rather than paired comparisons, offers advantages in job evaluation.

"The use of part family or group technology methods for machining operations is well established and several manufacturing systems baaed on this approach are in existence, as well as rationalized and automated procedures for design, process planning, etc. It is less well recognized that a similar approach to metal forming operations can lead to substantial benefits also. In this paper the possibilities for extending this approach to bulk metal forming operations (forging, stamping, etc.)are outlined. In particular systematic procedures for component and die design are described based on classification and coding systems for formed parts. In this context, the selection of forging features (draft, allowances, etc.), billet size estimation, and so on are considered. The use of group die sets, with interchangeable inserts, for families of similar parts is outlined. This technique enables die coats to be substantially reduced thus making forming operations more economically viable for small batches of parts. Combination of these techniques can lead to an integrated system for forming die design and manufacture, starting from the required as machined part through to the finished die. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The extreme cases of production operations—the job shop and the progressive assembly line—are viewed as special cases of a single general production model. They differ only in time span and the number of possible production routes.

"A single product, single Btage, multiperiod production smoothing problem is considered in this paper. Demands are monotonically increasing in successive periods, and in each period, they occur at a uniform rate. The important feature is that a production run can be started or ended at any time, and not necessarily at the start of any period. Considering production costs, costs due to change of production rate and inventory costs, unique optimal policies are derived. The special feature of the solution is that no iterative search procedure is needed to arrive at the optimal policy. On the other hand, a set of three conditions are derived. Once any one of these conditions is satisfied, the optimal policy is easily determined. Cost formulae are given for optimal policies derived. Three examples are solved to illustrate the optimal policies derived. Finally scope for application of the model is suggested. © 1975, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1975,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In most of the literature on performance analysis of production systems, buffer are assumed to be controlled locally. In automated production systems buffers are not always the result of local physical space restrictions, but may also be software-controlled. Software-controlled buffers allow a more efficient use of the production units and a better control of the work in progress. Some of these possible control principles are known from production control and goods flow theory. We present a model for production systems in which the goods flow is continuous. The effect of different control mechanisms on the performance of the system (that is throughput and throughput time) is studied. Examples of control systems are BSC (Base Stock Control), Workload Control and control by local buffers only.

"This paper presents a model for obtaining the optimal buffer space size in two-stage machining systems. It is shown that the optimal buffer space size is the one necessary to keep the critical machine running even when there are tool failures and subsequent tool changes on the non-critical machine. An analytical expression for the optimal buffer space size is derived when tool failures follow a Markovian process and the objective function is the minimization of the unit cost. A simulation mode! is developed for obtaining the optimal buffer space size when tool failures follow a non-Markovian process. It is shown that the optimal buffer space size depends on the expected delay time per part due to tool failures on the non-critical machine (which depends on the probability of tool failure on the non-critical machine during machining on the critical machine), on the labour and the buffer space cost, and on the tool-change time.

"This paper presents a model for calculating optimal cutting speeds and tool replacement policies for both operations of a two-stage machining problem when the unit cost is minimized or the profit rate is maximized. The tool life is assumed to be a stochastic variable and penalty costs are imposed for tool failures during production. The optimal size of buffer space between the two machines is also calculated analytically. It is shown that the unit cost increases as the tool variability and/or the penalty cost increase. The cutting speeds and tool replacement policies on both operations depend strongly on the tool variability and the penalty cost. The cutting speeds differ from those determined independently for each operation. Finally, the optimal buffer space size is the one necessary to keep the critical machine running when there is a tool change on the non-critical machine, and its optimal size can be calculated analytically. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Absenteeism is one of the major problems of Indian industries. It necessitates the employment of more manpower than the jobs require, resulting in the increase of manpower costs, and lowers the efficiency of plant operation through lowered performance and higher rejects. It also causes machine idleness, if extra manpower is not hired, resulting in disrupted work schedules and assignments. Several studies have investigated the causes of absenteeism (Vaid 1967) for example and their remedy and relationship between absenteeism and turnover with a suggested model for diagnosis and treatment (Hawk 1976) However, the production foremen and supervisor will face the operating task of determining how many extra operatives are to be hired in order to stave off the adverse effects of absenteeism on the man-machine system.

"In a two-stage lot production system, even in a pure flow-type, it is inevitable that idle periods arise at either stage because of the differences in set-up times, processing times, or lot sizes of items produced. The duration and location of idle periods on a repetitive production line could be modified by the number of set-ups or the sequence in a production run. The character of the two-stage lot production system makes it difficult to schedule optimal plans for certain values of system parameters, such as the lot sizes of items, waiting times between stages, and the utilization of each stage. Two kinds of items are introduced: one is ‘standard items’ under the assumptions of a constant usage rate, and production in both stages, and the other is ‘special order items’, stochastic demand at unpredictable intervals and production in either stage. Analytic formulations are made on the duration and location of idle periods, and relationships between the characteristics of the special order items and the idle periods. We propose the scheduling procedures of accepting as many special order items as possible utilizing the idle periods caused by the re-scheduling methods of the following three basic procedures: (1) shifting the production starting times of standard items, (2) changing lot sizes of standard items, and (3) executing both (1) and (2) at the same time. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The author develops a network of interlinked productivity indices and attempts thereby to propose a practical tool for studying the effect of Various factors on observed changes in man-year productivity. The system is devised to reflect the structure of possible working hours which consists of the following categories: non-working days and working days, days not worked and days worked, operated hours and omitted man-hours, and lost time and effective hours. Thus the index of man-year productivity is analysed by 19 indices which are interlinked indices of related factors. Among these factors, there are three groups of indices. The first group is a set of elemental indices which is composed of such indices as effective man-hours, operated man-hours, duty man-hours, days worked, working days, and rate of over-time work. The second group is a set of hierarchical indices of labour resource use such as rate of effective hours, ratio of operated hours to duty hours, ratio of duty man-hours to working man-days, and rate of working days. The third group is a set of indices of distribution of labour resources among products or sectors. The index number system necessarily includes some subcategories of labour productivity such as operated man-hour productivity, duty man-hour productivity and effective man-hour productivity.

"In a job shop, the intervale between job arrivals and the job processing times fluctuate and cannot be forecast. When many jobs (customers) arrive at a job shop at the same time, some customers may not place an order because they do not want to wait. To prevent such a situation, the job shop may temporarily increase the process capacity, thereby reducing the waiting time. If its timing is not correct, however, such an increase can also unexpectedly increase the idle time in the proess. In thii paper, the effects of fluctuetiona in the quantity of work arriving on waiting time, idle time and the rate of losing customers is studied using numerical calculations which wume extreme fluctuations. These characteristicashow different delays in their response to fluctuations in job arrivals. The paper deals with the index and timing for temporarily increasing and decreasing the process capacity to absorb the fluctuations in the quantity of work arriving, that is under what circumstances to do so and when. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Two alternative approaches to part-period balancing (PPB) a n modified for non-instantaneous receipt and compared in an experiment. Both models require a production adjustment to accommodate the gradual inventory buildup that occurs during the production run time. One of the models is based on the cumulative cost approach used in most PPB applications, whereas the other model utilizes the marginal cost concept that has been used effectively in some studies of part-period balancing under instantaneous receipt. The experiment involved 540 test problems with varying demand, production rates, and cost structures. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A now method of producing thin-walled seamless metal belts is discussed. The method incorporates the principles of float-rolling (CBS rolling), whereby metal strip is pinched between a small diameter floating roll and two large diameter back-up rolls which rotate with different peripheral speeds. Whereas in conventional rolling reduction may be controlled by regulating the roll gap opening, in float-rolling reduction is insensitive to changes in roll gap opening and is controlled instead by varying the speed differential between the two back-up rolls. In this report, the relationships between reduction and roll speeds, roll gap opening, and strip tension are described, and some observations of rolling loads and torques are reported. Several problems associated with the production of belts by the float-rolling method are also discussed. © 1973 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Superficially the education system has many of the key elements of a manufacturing organization: a product, tolerance limits for the product, methods for assessing product deviation, and a feedback system for making compensatory adjustments. These elements are: educated youth, educational goals or objectives, performance tests, and a reporting system. Their existence has led some ‘ managers ’ to attempt a wholesale application of the systems framework to education. This paper analyses some of the reasons for the comparative lack of success of such attempts. It is shown that rather than modelling the total system (which, because of its open loop characteristics, is probably an impossible task of limited usefulness), systems analysts should focus on those aspects of education which can be systematized. Such aspects are: resource allocation, scheduling, prediction systems (research and evaluation), and data-bank systems. It is considered that successful education system models require that: (I) the designers recognize that schools are'pol itical entities, and (2) the system must be focussed at the level of the individual student. The implications of those assumptions are discussed. © 1972 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Traditionally, the human factors evaluation of displays is focused on input aspects (e.g. ratio of lino width to height, use of colour, visibility, etc.). Acquisition measures (e.g. reaction-time, reading speed, etc.) have typically been chosen as dependent variables. However, many displays of interest (e.g. those for Command and Control) require the observer not only to acquire information but also to manipulate- the displayed data and derive a decision that is judicious as well as timely. This paper will summarize a series of studies in which a decision adequacy metric was applied to the evaluation of displays. It will be shown that several of the relationships previously found (using acquisition variables) are either modified or reversed when we focus on the goodness of display based decisions. A programme of research expanding on these studies will also be described. © 1972 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper deals with service level constraints which are defined over a fiscal period. Fiscal-period-bssed m i c e level constraints are considerably more complex than their lead-time counterparts and result in significantly different safety stock requirements. Thus, a confusion between a lead-time and fiscalperiod perspective can result in substantial financial consequences and is therefore of managerial relevance. Although no generalizations are possible from the limited results presented, further computational experience suggests that the Gndiigs reported hold over a wide range of situations. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A recent study of the quality improvement process in a cross-section of UK manufacturing industry has been carried out. This paper discusses how organizations become motivated to improve their product and service quality, the ways in which the quality improvement process can get started, the barriers to improvement, and the key factors for success. It is pointed out that the quality improvement process is a form of organizational change which requires the intervention of powerful change agents, of which demanding customers are the most influential. To succeed, quality improvement needs the commitment and effective leadership of the chief executive and his senior management team.

"In this paper a new approach to short-term workshop scheduling problema is presented. The situations treated are dynamical rather than static. The approach does not use a mathematical-programming point of view of the operations research, Instead, it is an ‘ automatic-control ’ or ‘ system-theory ’ approach. The system studied is the finishing workshop of some cloth industry. The spocific situation of this workshop is the high amount of perturbations (20%) which renders normal scheduling inefficient. The suggested solution is the use of a regulating scheme, which operates on the basis of an adaptive model simulating the operating conditions of the workshop. In the first part of the paper, the system is described and the problem formulated. In the second part, the constitution of the simulation model is presented and results for its validation given. Finally, the regulating method is discussed and computer operating results are shown. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A concept using an optimization technique to design multi-edge BTA tools with cutters ‘taggered’ on the cutting head is developed. The cutting edges are located on the head so that they cut in a circular pattern over a portion of the hole radius, partly overlapping with each other. In many applications these tools should be superior to the conventional single-edge tools or multi-edge tools with cutters located at 180 degress to each other. When heavy cuts and large hole sizes are attempted with single-edge tools a large resultant force transmitted to the bore wall through the guiding pads causes undue rubbing and wear of the pads. This is followed by heat generation and increased power consumption and deterioration of the cutting edges. The tools with a staggered or zigzag arrangement of the cutters are designed for a predetermined cutting force resultant necessary for the tool guidance, which is controlled by appropriate radial and angular location of the cutters on the cutting head. The cutters of these tools can be combined at will, taking standard carbide inserts or trepanning insets of various grades to satisfy the hardness and toughness requirements, which change according to the increase in cutting speed by radius. The concept also offers more flexibility with regard to space required for chipmouths and chipthroats, resulting in better mass balance as well as the higher rigidity and strength of cutting heads. The design procedure includes the mathematical model of cutting force components, the optimization and simulation procedure yielding the optimal tool-design parameters which are used for tool layouts. The preliminary tests of the two tool prototypes indicate that these tools are superior to the single-edge tools. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The factor of frictional losses for both laminar and turbulent coolant flow through the passages in a gundrill bas been investigated. A kidney shaped paasage in the tip has been used because it is superior to both single circular and double circular passages. An extensive experimental investigation revealed a considerable deviation from the Blasius relation for circular passages. The concept of hydraulic diameter used to predict friction in circular passages fails to predict the friction in the kidney shaped passage. The results of this investigation suggest that by introducing a concept of a characteristic dimension of the paasage cross-section, the friction can be predicted in a relatively simple manner similar to the Blasius approach. Computer fitting of the experimental data resulted in an empirical relation which can be uscd to calcula, te the factor of frictional losses in a kidney shaped gundrill passage for coolant. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Consider a realistic unpaced-line problem: there is a set of discrete tasks, whose task-time distributions have divem shapes.

"Numerous empirical studies have shown that, in unpaced lines, the stations' processing times have a variety of shapes (i.e., skewness and kurtosis))65. Thispaper investigates how the line's utilization factor is affected by these skewness and kurtosis measures. We found that positive skewness has a significant negative effect on utilization, and that the magnitude of this effect is greater if the line has more stations or less buffer capacity, or if the processing-times' cv is larger. Kurtosis also affects utilization significantly, but the effect may be negative or positive, depending upon the processing-times' skewness and the number of stations in the line. Our findings imply that when simulating long lines with small buffer capacities, it may be necessary to model more accurately the actual processing times. Also, the common practice of using normal distributions to approximate the typically positively-skewed processing times often leads to an overestimation of the actual utilization rate. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A distinction is made between the technical details of pay plans and the decision process that is used in developing and administering them. Data are presented which show that pay plans which are identical in technical details can produce quite different results in terms of motivation and satisfaction. It appears that when employees are active participants in the development and administration of pay plans, plans are more likely to be successful. Several studies are cited which support this point and it is argued that the reasons for this include the fact that participation increases employee trust of a pay plan. Finally, it is pointed out that pay can serve as a change agent in organization development efforts if the efforts begin with and involve employees participating in pay decisions. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of utmost importance to the firm is the achievement of the most efficient utilization of its available resources while adhering to the restrictions of its economic environment. One of the inherent difficulties with present linear programming formulations of the coordinated production and logisties planning problem is the failure to include the multiple goals intrinsic to the planning of the firm. The model to be presented in this paper will consider three commonly occurring goals of the firm in coordinating production and logistics planning. These are (1) the maximization of total sales revenue for a specific location and customer; (2) the minimization of total production and distribution costs; and finally, (3) the maximization of production for a particular item at a particular location.

"A CAD/CAM system with some new numerical methods is presented in this paper. This system mainly consists of two stages. In stage 1, the least squares method is applied to fit a best form of parametric surface to a set of data points obtained from a 3D coordinate measuring machine, with the errors caused by the probe compensated. In stage 2, from the best form of parametric surface obtained in stage 1, a new efficient method—adaptive path planning—which has better performance than the old parametric method is developed to generate the cutter path. By application of adaptive path planning, machining time can be reduced. By transforming the cutter contact path to the cutter location path, the curvature method for detecting gouging is presented by which a tool path with gouging avoidance can be generated. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A limitation of the Swift test for drawability is that, being based on the drawing of a round cup, it cannot bo applied to non-circular cups. To be applicable to non-circular cups the definition of drawability, and the test or tests based on it must entail a more generalized concept than the largest drawing ratio. Such a generalized definition, is proposed, and it is derived from the basic ideas in the Swift test. A measuro for the draw-in, analogous to the surface strain, is proposed to replace the drawing ratio and the boundary of the product is defined both for specifying the stage at which the drawing operation is completed and for the determination of the draw-in. The choice of the blank size, which is simple in the Swift teat, becomes more complex in the case of cups with boundaries of different sizes. In the non-circular cups, the maximization of the draw-in, which is basic and essential to the concept of drawability, can be achieved by choosing the shape and the orientations of the blank, as well as the size. Actual examples are shown of the variation of drawability with the size of the blank, the shape of the blank, the orientation of the blank, the size of the boundary of the product, as well as with the shape of the cup. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Within the past several years, considerable research has been devoted to the aggregate production planning problem starting with the pioneering work of Holt el al, (1955) and the resulting Linear Decision Rule (LDR). However, researchers have also recognized that developing optimal aggregate production plans, per se, is not sufficient for solving real problems; these plans have to be disaggregated into specific schedules for specific products. Consequently, the thrust of current research is on the ‘disaggregation’ problem. Simultaneously a number of companies have been installing MRP systems with reports of significant improvements in inventory control, production planning, work force scheduling and production costs. This paper reports on an experiment which was designed and conducted to compare the effectiveness of the ‘aggregate-disaggregate’ and MRP approaches to production planning in a simulation environment.

"Much has been written on the essential features and potential benefits of the Justin-Time production system. Using a simulation model, some salient parameters such as (a)scheduling rules, (6) the effects of pull demands level, (c) the effects of the production Kanban size and the minimum Kan ban level, and (d) the significance of the job mix are evaluated. The study shows that a common prevailing practice of assigning greater priorities to jobs with higher pull frequencies is not as efficient as a shortest process time based rule. Unlike the traditional ‘push’ method, raising the pull demand in a JIT system does not ensure a high process utilization level. Results also show that an increase in the production Kanban size and minimum output Kanban level improve the mean job tardiness but causes an escalation in the output Kanban inventory level. Contrary to common conjecture, an enlarged product mix would actually produce better process utilization and mean job tardiness. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are also other reasons which may require rescheduling. If the number of orders is high, and a change also has effects on the delivery of other orders, the rescheduling may be very complicated.

"This paper addresses the new conception of a real-time expert system for elementary two-arm assembly operations under the inclusion of operation-based vision. Every operation is represented by a local blackboard which contains a recognition part, a world model and a measurement part. The total set of these behaviour-oriented modules is supervised and scheduled by an operation monitor, which is again a blackboard. The local-knowledge sources of each individual blackboard receive sensor signals as input and can directly produce a reaction without going to a higher-level global-inference engine. This local, short connection between sensor signal and reflex is decided on the basis of compiled rules which have the form of production rules. The main types of these rules are regulation tasks depending on the operation and analysis rules for situation assessments. Global plans are produced as assembly graphs and transmitted in parts to the operation monitor as task specifications. A 3-D CAD modeller is used to support the object representation and recognition. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Despite much research activity there is widespread failure to use available computer programs for planning the layout of manufacturing facilities. There appear to be two reasons for this: (a) the widely held opinion that an experienced planner can produce acceptable layouts based on his own subjective judgement, and (b) ignorance of the potential benefits of computer-aided techniques. This paper reports the results of an extensive investigation into the performance of both human planners and computer algorithms on a standard set of layout problems. Attention is drawn to the important concepts of flow dominance F and problem complexity. Well known computer programs such as CRAFT and CORELAP were included in the research as well as new programs developed by the authors.

In addition, by assigning penalty cost for long makespans, the optimal process routes for each part and optimal load for each machine in terms of minimum production cost can be obtained with lower makespan. An example problem is solved, followed by discussions with regard to the impact of batch splitting, setup cost and demand change on optimal solution. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Starting with forecast demand data, the methodology to be described here can derive a detailed production schedule which provides smooth continuous operations in a modern steel manufacturing system. The production schedule will satisfy the customers' orders and other desired objectives at the lowest possible energy costs. Two mathematical programming models and a sequencing heuristic are developed at different levels of an integrated control hierarchy. A simulation model, used to evaluate the planned system and investigate the primary results, has also been built. The statistical analysis indicates the performance improvements of the planned steel making process. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Production controls based on mean value analysis and steady-state conditions are incapable of making on-time decisions that cope with unexpected dynamic events which are due to interruptions in complex work flow characteristic of modern production lines. One of the most significant dynamic events in production situations is a sudden machine/operator breakdown/outage. Computer simulation is known to be a useful tool for modelling the dynamic response of a system to machine breakdown, but it takes too long to perform its analysis to provide the response time necessary for control procedures. Analytical methods provide formulae which are suitable for real-time analysis, but there are no results available for transient behaviour associated with machine breakdown. Metamodelling is the process of summarizing the results of a simulation study in analytical form. In this paper, we present our metamodels for the dynamic behaviour of both time in system and number in system for a general arrival time, general service time, multi-station, multi-server production line system. The formulae are exponential in nature and are developed through a study of first-order differential equations from system control theory. The constants used in our results are determined off-line through discrete-event simulation analysis. The metamodels themselves are available to on-line users as a predictor of parts that will be delayed because of breakdown(s) as a function of time in the future. The integrated approach of using simulation for modelling system details and analytic method for describing the revealed system transient behaviour is a powerful methodology for analysing large-scale production systems. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The basic model for determining optimal lot sizes in production-inventory systems is: (the lot size = Z). If interactions between two or more products of the system cause restrictions to be laid upon the lot sizes, the technique of Lagrangian multipliers may be used for solving the lot size problem. A successful practical application of the Lagrange-technique depends largely upon the availability of electronic data-processing equipment. In business situations, deviations from optimal lot sizes are often required for reasons not included in the model. As shown in the second part of this paper, the economic consequences of the deviations can be determined approximately without any great calculation. It is also indicated that the economic consequences caused by moderate deviations are rather small compared with the total costs involved in the whole production inventory system. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1967,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The striving for market-oriented production has resulted in increased needs for flexibility in the production process. In many cases it is the final value-adding component (i.e. assembly) in the manufacturing chain that has the largest pressures for flexibility. However, the internal and external vendors can restrict the flexibility of a nominally flexible assembly plant. Without the necessary flexibility in earlier production stages a total flexibility will only be achieved through large inventories and other trade-offs. In this paper based on an empirical study carried out in cooperation with a large Swedish manufacturer, the authors show that total flexibility in a multi-stage production chain primarily depends on capacity levels and work organization. It is concluded in the case presented here that large investments must be made in labour education and organizational adaptation in order to exploit the full potentials of a highly mechanized final assembly department. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Swedish experience of changes of payment systems indicates that there is a strong link between payment-by-results and the way the work organization functions. In fact the efficiency-promoting effects of payments-by-results to a great extent is explained by positive indirect effects on work forms, production planning and control, supervision and the readiness at the shop floor level to counteract and neutralize production disturbances and variations. This paper takes account of material from a study by Dr. Jan Edgren of changes in the payment system on the development, of events at a Granges die-casting shop. It is pointed out that the indirect effects of payment systems make payment-by-results a strategic factor or leading system in the development of the shop floor organization and work forms.

"Expert systems have demonstrated their ability to solve problems of a specific domain and achieve quality performance. The technology has been applied in numerous engineering areas. In this paper, an expert system based AS/RS controller, ECSSIM, is presented. The system plans a control strategy based on the long term system characteristics. However, the system alters the control strategy tactically according to the short term control needs. The system performed very well particularly at high demand levels. It also demonstrated its capability of sensing poor control strategies, and tactically compensate for the strategy selection error. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Recently, much research had been undertaken to develop and evaluate flexible assembly systems (FAS), a technology rated as the number one growth opportunity for robots. While robots are generally the basis of these systems, they are often difficult to justify economically and tend to increase the complexity of the workplace. A recent trend in flexible assembly has been the utilization of reprogrammable pick and place devices for specific tasks. These devices are generally non-servo controlled, pneumatically powered, ‘low technology’ robots. Although they have a limited operation sequence, they offer low investment and fast cycle times. Because of the increasing interest in low technology robots for assembly, the objective of this project was to develop and evaluate a pick and place part handling device. Physical characteristics of the prototype robot such as repeatability, operating pressure, and stroke length were tested to determine performance trends that developed. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The application of a previously developed method for fitting skill acquisition data with hyperbolic functions is shown by means of ft model and actual data. The hyperbolic function yields explicit information on prior practice. The ability to account for prior practice makes it possible to analyse experimental methodology in a more rigorous manner than previously possible. The error that may be inherent in typical procedures can be quantified. The errors are greatest at early stages of learning, smallest when learning is far advanced. From the equations, one can calculate the number of trials required before the error term is below a. specified value. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The purpose of this paper is to develop an algorithm which solves the M by J scheduling problem on the basis of interatively changing the data of the problem while maintaining an optimum solution along the path. The algorithm is applicable to a rather broad class of optimization problems of the classical O.R.

The algorithm is then applied to the M by J scheduling problem.

"Over the last decade increasing attention has been devoted to introducing optimization into queueing models. The emphasis has predominantly been upon choosing facilities to minimize cost of servicing a given demand. Recently there has been some discussion of optimal balking rules and charges in order to influence demand. Now the concept of pricing to determine the optimal level of congestion (e.g. on roads) has long been familiar to economists. However, such economic analyses have not been couched in terms of queueing theory nor do recent texts in operational research reflect the economic approach. This paper therefore gives a concise derivation and discussion of the pricing principle in terms of one of the simplest queueing models. A graphical interpretation is also available which should aid in the intuitive understanding of the more sophisticated models referred to. The general implication of these analyses is that, just as providing ‘ excess ” capacity is worth while if it costs less than the cost of delays avoided, so it is also worth while to turn away arrivals or reduce usage as long as the benefit thus sacrificed is more than offset by reduction in cost of delay. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We address the routeing control problem, where the routeings of jobs from the central buffer to each station are to be determined periodically to minimize the in-process inventory costs.

"The work described in this paper is part of a large investigation of the usage of statistical methods of quality control (SQC) in British manufacturing industry. The introduction provides a review of previous work, which revealed that industry in the UK makes surprisingly little use of SQC techniques. These results were so striking that a further investigation was initiated to discover: (i) the ‘barriers to acceptance’ of SQC (ii) a methodology for its successful implementation This paper describes the first phase of this work, which was aimed at discovering the reasons for the low usage of SQC. In summary, the major barrier preventing companies from introducing SQC is lack of knowledge. Whilst this was often not the first reason given, much circumstantial evidence from questionnaires and direct evidence from interviews suggests that decisions are often taken on the basis of very little or no knowledge. Clearly, there is an urgent need to increase awareness and knowledge of SQC. © 1984 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The aim of cellular manufacturing systems is to group parts that have similar processing needs into part families, and machines that meet these needs into machine cells. In this paper, intracell moves are recognized as being as important and unproductive an element as intercell moves are in cellular manufacturing. An efficient solution algorithm based on a model describing the total moves contributed by both intercell and intracell moves has been developed. Appropriate weights have been chosen to represent the total moves in equation form as a weighted sum of both intercell and intracell moves. In addition to the total moves, utilization of a workstation in a cell has been evaluated and used in the determination of the best workstation and part assignments to the respective cells from among a choice of solutions. This choice is made possible by varying the number of cells between a priori determined minimum and maximum values. The algorithm has been tested on problems selected from published literature, and the results presented show that this algorithm determines at least as good a solution or a superior and more realistic solution when compared to those reported in the past. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The importance of target luminance in evaluating tho relative efficiency of structured versus unstructured search in a large and visually homogeneous field is discussed. Differences in detection times appear to be due to the apparent luminance of the target. Detection is a result of a trade-off between the physical luminance of the target and the degree of spatial uncertainty associated with a particular search pattern. In a structured visual field, with a systematic search pattern, the spatial uncertainty of the target is conceived as being lower than with an unstructured field and search pattern. Evidence from studies on visual search and on the effect of spatial uncertainty on visual performance are presented.

"For many production processes there are economies of scale with plant investments and certain operating costs. With long-term increases in demand this affects the timing and sizing of capacity expansion projects. This paper is concerned with the development of optimal expansion programmes. It applies dynamic programming models to minimize the present value of capita! costs, operating expenses and capacity shortage losses. The paper considers homogeneous production capacity and heterogeneous plant where constituent units have different economies of scale arid working lives. The algorithm is applied to the analysis of an expansion programme for an integrated pulp mill. The planning implications of such models are considered. Using sensitivity analysis, a number of variables such as discount rates, inflation effects and demand patterns are related to the economy scale factor.

"Many manufacturing environments consist of a final assembly shop that receives components from various feeder shops. Suppose the final assembly shop assembles a mix of products, each requiring varying amounts of different components. Thus, the sequence in which products are assembled imposes time-dependent demands on the feeder shops. Such problems are often found in the assembly of high-tech telecommunications systems and in the assembly of mixed models of automobiles. We develop a variety of models that link the work-in-process inventory in the feeder shop and the finished component inventory to the component production interval and the final assembly sequence. The manufacturing disciplines considered include push, look-ahead and kanban. Feeder shops are assumed to manufacture components continuously, periodically, or at a fixed lot size. Simple performance characteristics of the feeder shop are derived to provide insight into synchronized manufacturing issues and to help evaluate the effect of different final assembly sequences on feeder shops. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper presents an application of a new network-based simulation model to a class of production line systems and compare this with a closed form procedure. The new model is capable of analysing more realistic production lines by allowing variable work dement times (normal and others), parallel stations, in-process inventory, and merging subassembly lines. Furthermore, the model is capable of handling mixed model and batched assembly situations as well as the single product assembly lines. The inclusion of cost and resoun-c options, as integral components makes the model a powerful tool of analysis. The cost option allows evaluation of alternative configurations based on the total tost of the system; whereas, the resource feature enables one to analyse the constrained resource situations. The model can be used to optimize the design of new processing lines and to balance existing lines with a fixed production requirement. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Adapting to changes over time is a primary point in any forecasting system. The quicker the adaptation the better the resulting forecasts. This is very important in computerized forecast-inventory control systems that manage thousands of parts.

"This paper considers an operational system made up of a number of independent and identical units. A given number, N, must be in service and it is supported by a maintenance float. We estimate the float factors using a Taylor series approximation of the gamma distribution for failures and a log normal function for repairs. From the model developed for the gamma case, the exponential, erlang-2 and degenerate cases are obtained. It is shown that the maintenance float factors approach asymptotic values for large N, This paper extends the previous research on maintenance float modelling and shows that the maintenance float factors are independent of N for large values of N. This property is used to obtain a simpler formula for maintenance float factor for the gamma failure distribution. Unlike the formulae obtained for the cases of exponential and Weibull failure distributions, the gamma failure yields a more complex formula. The asymptotic model considerably reduces the computational efforts involved. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The problem of facilities design involves the assignment of facilities to available locations so as to minimize the total cost. When N new facilities are to be added to an existing layout, there are N! feasible ways in which the assignment can be completed. Presented in this paper is a simple method to calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the total costs for the N! feasible layouts. The method is also useful for analysing the distribution of the total cost for the general facilities design problem when n' out of N facilities have been assigned to suitable locations and n (i.e. N-n') facilities are left for assignment. These parameters are of importance to the facilities design engineer who is solving the problem by any construction algorithm where the layout is completed by successive addition of facilities to locations. At any stage when the location of the first (n'- 1) facilities have been decided, the possible effect of assigning the n'th. facility to the jth location can be predicted by estimating the mean and variance of the distribution of the total cost associated with the assignment. © 1984 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Balanced, and nearly or completely unbalanced systems, are considered. In more complex cases, to improve the efficiency of computation, an algorithm is introduced, which decomposes the system into balanced and unbalanced parts, and allows the formulae already derived for these simple cases to be utilized. The intermediate results are expressed in the form of finite discrete sequences. From the convolution of these sequences, the behaviour of the whole system is obtained. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In this paper a mathematical model is developed for an inventory system in which the numher of units of acceptable in a replenishment lot is uncertain and the demand is partially captive. It is assumed that the fraction of the demand during the stockout period which can be backordered is a random variable whose probability distribution is known. The optimal replenishment policy is synthesized for such a system. A numerical example is used to illustrate. the theory. The results indicate that the optimal replenishment policy is sensitive to the nature of the demand during the stockout period. © 1985 Taylor and Francis Ltd.,1985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most multiple-objective approaches to solving the facility layout problem generate different layouts by varying the weights of the objectives using heuristic methods. It is possible, however, to generate the same layout using different weights. It is also possible that many efficient layouts will not be generated because it is not clear which weights would generate them. Furthermore, there may be some efficient layouts that cannot be generated regardless of what weights are used. In this paper we propose a heuristic algorithm for generating efficient layouts through pairwise interchange of departments. We show that if the decision maker’s preferences for the selection of the best layout cannot be expressed as a linear utility function, it is essential to use other techniques such as the one developed in this paper, rather than weighting techniques, to generate efficient layouts. An example and some experiments are discussed. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A multicriteria quality control model for acceptance sampling is developed which defines several conflicting and non-commensurate objectives. The following objectives are proposed and quantified in this model: (1) to minimize the cost of inspection, (2) to minimize the number of critical defects, (3) to minimize the number of major defects, and (4) to minimize the number of minor defects. The interactive paired comparison method identifies the most desirable sample sizes and acceptance levels for critical, major, and minor defects for a given lot size. At each iteration a small number of alternatives is presented to a decision maker. The decision maker chooses the most favourable alternative by expressing his/her strength of preference for pairs of alternatives. An unknown non-linear utility function of objectives is assumed. The optimal sampling plan is determined using a minimal number of interactions. A computer package is developed and used to determine the optimal sampling plan for an application in the lamp-making industry. The computer package is used to run a variety of experiments. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this paper, we formulate the quadratic assignment problem through multiple objective programming in which we can have several objectives. In the facility layout problem, the objectives can be materials handling cost, production rate, and flexibility. We define efficiency and describe how efficient alternatives can be generated. A heuristic procedure based on pairwise exchange of subfacilities is developed to generate the efficient solution associated with a given set of objective weights. Our approach could just as easily implement the graph theoretic or other approaches to solve the quadratic assignment problem and generate efficient points associated with given weights. A paired comparison method based on the strength of preference among alternatives is developed. The paired comparison method generates the decision maker's weights of an assumed unknown utility function. The method asks simple questions and uses linear programming to solve the problem. An experiment with the developed computer package is discussed. Some examples are provided for solving the facility layout problem. © 1987 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this paper we develop an expert system for multiple-criteria facility layout problems. The facility layout problem is identified as an ill-structured problem; our approach for solving it is based on expert systems and multiple-criteria decision making (MCDM). The expert system interacts with the decision maker (DM), and reflects the DM's preferences in the selection of rules and priorities. The inference engine is a forward-chaining reasoning procedure which is discussed in detail. The approach consists of two parts: (a) construction of a layout based on a set of rules and restrictions, and (b) improvement of the layout based on interaction with decision maker. The MCDM expert system approach considers and incorporates the multiple criteria in these two parts as follows. In (a) it uses priorities on the selection of rules, adjacency of departments, and departments for construction purposes. In (b) it uses different objectives such as materials handling cost, flexibility, and materials handling time for paired comparison of generated layouts for improvement purposes. Some experiments with the developed computer package are reported and an example is solved. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper presents an accelerated approach and an automated system for short-term machinability evaluation of metal materials. The proposed approach is developed for ranking materials in terms of machinability. It considers both objective factors, such as machine variables and process outputs, and subjective factors, such as the decision maker's preferences regarding different criteria (objectives, e.g. operation cost, production rate, and product quality). A set of analytical and empirical formulas relevant to different aspects of machinability are identified. A definition of machinability as a function of process outputs is proposed. A method for assessing the weights of importance of different criteria is proposed. Based on the approach, a computer software package called MACPRO for machinability assessment is developed. The computerized machinability evaluation system interfacing with sensors is configured to facilitate data sampling/processing and man/machine interactions. Results of experiments with different work-piece materials for a manufacturing company and problem are analysed and discussed. The results indicate that the approach and designed system are reliable, robust, fast (about half an hour), and easy to implement. The approach is currently being implemented and used in some major metal cutting industries. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Flexibly automated facilities permit a wider variety of products as well as objectives for making those products—thus requiring manufacturing control strategies to face an environment of ever present change. To operate in this environment, a system composed of hard automation, flexible automation and humans, which can be responsive to product and process requirements, machine breakdowns and delays, engineering changes and improvement opportunities, is needed. Such a system does not fall into the realm of any current manufacturing solution techniques. Something more than exact optimization, heuristic algorithms or stochastic estimates must be utilized. The research discussed herein describes a dynamic solution strategy to operate in this changing environment with adaptive self-improving characteristics. The proposed methodology for optimizing the control of an automated manufacturing facility is an integrated approach utilizing real-time feedback from the operating facility, direct feedback from a simulation of the facility and guidance from a historical knowledge base. This system is being implemented in a knowledge based environment called CAYENE. CAYENE is a hybrid artificial intelligence system, written in Lisp, based on the idea of using object oriented programming as a unifying principle for functional, frame and rule-based programming. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In the area of production planning, the technology transfer from the developed world to developing countries should take into account the expensive machinery and economies of scale. In developed countries, equipment is cheap but manpower is expensive. Thus production planning models are built so that manpower is never idle. In developing countries the machines are much more expensive and maintenance plays a bigger role. Thus production planning models should be built which include the machine idle cost and maintenance costs. This paper explains how such models can be analytically developed. Finally, it is -shown that demand can be stimulated though economies of scale and inductrial goods can be provided at much cheaper rates. © 1979, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the manufacture of metal cans tinplate is a major cost item and when the scale of output of cans, say, in the food industry, is considered, it is obvious that efficient utilization of material is a factor of considerable economic importance. The first part of this paper analyses in some detail the parameters which determine the optimal H/D ratio when trim losses are taken into account and makes a comparison with actual can dimensions used in the food industry. Having stated the optimal dimensions for an individual can, this study first attempts to estimate the sensitivity of these optimal conditions, that is to say what material wastage is expected to occur if deviations from optimal dimensions; are considered. Secondly it was felt that the optimal solutions should be subjected to consumer tests so that some indication might be given as to customers' preferences, and to whether these are compatible with the theoretical optimal dimensions. Thirdly a solution is suggested for a multi-can programme in which a series of cans have a common diameter, and the implications of such a system on material utilization are discussed. For a cylindrical can it can be shown by simple calculus that optimal use of tin plate is achieved when the height of the can is equal to its diameter. This, however, ignores trim losses in punching out end caps from a metal strip, which if accounted for may effect the HjD ratio quite appreciably. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1964,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An analytical modelling strategy is proposed as a screening device for use prior to the simulation phase in the design of zone control automated guided vehicle systems (AGVS). The proposed model predicts the effects of the major AGVS design variables on system-performance measures including maximum throughput capacity and risk factors associated with shop locking. This is done through a process which specifically evaluates the system operating dynamics associated with vehicle fleet size, guidepath layout, workstation storage capacity, routeing, and, to a less precise extent, vehicle dispatching. Operating dynamics are defined to include vehicle blocking resulting from guidepath contention and variation of in-process storage levels. The objective of the analytical model is to reduce the extent of simulation modelling necessary to design a zone-control AGVS for a given materials-handling workload. The model is illustrated for a sample AGVS with variation in the fleet size, workstation storage capacity and dispatching rule demonstrated. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Trained subjects performed a simple assembly task under self-paced and machine-paced working conditions. Work cycle times, respiratory intervals and cardiac R—R intervals were recorded continuously throughout 2 hours of unpaced and 2 hours of paced work of the same rate as the subject's mean unpaced performance. The two kinds of work were shown to be physiologically different, not in the direction physiological changes, but in their general levels and rates of change. The results indicated that the unpaced work imposed a higher load upon the subject than the paced work. It is also indicated that the organism may be prepared in advance for the work under unpaced conditions, while it seems to be ‘driven’ by the machine under paced conditions, and works with a kind of momentary ‘physiological lag’. © 1977, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The major problem in the operation of a selective assembly plan is “mismatching”, where the number of components in one category does not match the numbers in the corresponding category of the mating component. This is generally because of the wide differences between the natural variability exhibited by the processes producing the parts.

"présente ici quelques résultats d'une étude sociologique effectuée auprés du personnel d'un important établissement administratif, profondément engagé dans I'application des principes d'organisation scientifique du travail. Un des objectifs de cette recherche était de déterminer dans quelle mesure la rationalisation du travail administratif modifie les attitudes et les comportements au travail traditionnels en milieu *employé * Sont successivement analysés les attitudes du personnel à l' égard du travail, de 1'autorité, de la promotion, ainsi que le mode de relation avec l'organisation et la façon dont est perçu le s-tatut de la profession. L'organisation sur laquelle porte I' étude est fortement centralisée. La direction manifeste un souci marqué de se situcr a l' ávant-garde, tant sur le plan de la technique administrative que sur celui des pratiques de *relations humaines*. La plupart des employés sont affectés á des tâches simples, répétitives, dont I'exécution ne laisse pas de place à I'initiative. Les possibilités de promotion sont limitées, mais une complète séé;curite est assurée au personnel sur tous les plans. En dépit d'une apparente satisfaction, ces employés (en majorité feminins et agés de moins de trente-cinq ans) se montrent peu intégrés à I'organisation : ils ont tendance à dévaloriser la plupart des aspects de la vie professionnelle auxquels les travailleurs non-manuels se montrent traditionnellement attachés (les relations hiérarchiques, la promotion, le statut de la profession) et à se désintéresser de tout se qui ne concerne pas la stricte exécution du travail quotidien (fonctionnement et vie de 'entreprise aussi bien qu' activités syndicates). Leur adaptation, de type * apathique *, n'est pas sans rappeler celle que I'on a I'habitude d'observer en usine parmi les catégories d'ouvriers peu qualifiés.Ce mode d'adaptation du personnel crée des problèmes au niveau de l'entreprise clle-même: la capacité d'adaptation au changement que I'révolution technologique requiert de plus en plus des organisations se trouve directement affectée par une attitude générate de non-participation du personnel; la cooperation de celui-ci est en effet indispensable au succés des réorganisations de complexité et d'ampleur sans cesse accrues auxquelles les entreprises sont amenées à procéder à un rythme accéiéré par rapport au passé.

Le problème de l'apathie ne peut être résolu que dans la mesure oùune double action est entreprise au niveau de l'organisation et au niveau des hommes.

Statistical analysis is used to determine whether significant differences exist between the two layouts.

"ANSI Zl-4 is a set of sampling plans and procedures for sampling inspection by attributes which includes provisions for switching between normal, tightened, and reduced inspections as a function of the quality history. In the latest version of ANSI Zl-4 (American National Standard 1981), the switching rules were revised to simplify its use. Specifically, the use of the limit numbers in switching between normal and reduced inspections was made optional. Moreover, a statement in the standard suggests that the use of limit numbers will have little impact on the performance of the scheme. This paper describes the use of a simulation model to explore the effect of using the limit number criterion on the scheme's performance. The use of the limit numbers significantly impacted all seven of the performance measures across the 36 levels of sample size, acceptance number, And quality level examined in this study. The use of the optional limit numbers reduced the lots inspected prior to termination by 21%, the transitions between normal and reduced inspections by 55%, and fraction of lots inspected under reduced inspection by 51%, Using the limit numbers increased the fraction of lots rejected by 30%, the average run length on normal inspection by 37%, and the lots inspected on normal inspection by 36%. The results show that the limit numbers are effective in eliminating random switching between normal and reduced inspection. © 1987 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is accomplished by utilizing the concepts of a time variable earning rate and continuous compounding A number of examples are provided to illustrate the use of the method in cases of uniform, increasing, decreasing and cyclic earning rates, and comparisons are made with the conventional analyses. © 1970 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1970,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The purpose of this paper is two fold: first to provide a method for evaluating projects which have an income pattern describable by a polynomial function of time, and to provide a means for evaluating projects which exhibit a yearly growth or decline in earnings while maintaining the ability to account for the time pattern of earnings, and second to bring forth an assessment technique which will reflect the possibility of attaining various levels of income for each of the periods of interest. Methods utilized in developing the various models are based on the concept of dynamic return. The future and present worths of a project are calculated for the case in which the earnings follow a pattern of the form given by either Ctm or C(l — t)m. Two types of growth patterns, geometric, in which earnings increase or decline by a fixed percentage each year, and arithmetic, in which earnings increase or decrease by a fixed amount each year, are analyzed. Finally, an income model based on the binomial distribution is developed for evaluating projects which could have two income levels, each having an associated probability. Upper and lower confidence limits for the present and future worths of the project are calculated. Extensions are noted which will permit the inclusion of any of a number of levels of profit for each year of the project. © 1970 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",1970,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Material requirements planning (MRP) is a way to develop the time phased material and other resource requirements to satisfy the needs of a master production schedule. Hierarchical production planning (HPP) is a framework for analysis and decision making in complex production environments. They are complementary approaches to the decision support system needs of multi-stage production systems. The hierarchical approach provides for efficient management review of proposed plans at corporate, plant, and shop levels while MRP provides a sound and detailed basis for understanding the implications of proposed plans and for executing the selected plan. The relationships between these two approaches are illustrated with an example application. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eight subjects performed a paced conveyor inspection task of small zinc-plated washers. There were two fault types, one considerably more difficult to detect than the other. Each fault type had a probability of occurrence of 0-0, 0-025 or 0 05 providing eight different batch conditions, four where only one fault type was present and four where both were present. All subjects were tested twice on each of the eight conditions. There were 1800 washers in each batch condition, which were inspected at a rate of 3 per second. The results demonstrated that the probability of detection of either fault type was significantly reduced when subjects were searching for the two fault types simultaneously, the decrease in probability being greater the larger the a priori probability of the other fault type. Signal detection theory analysis suggested that these results were due to changes in sensitivity rather than in response bias. The classical vigilance effect of signal probability was not observed. © 1979, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Variables acceptance sampling plans are designed under the assumption that measurement on the characteristic of interest may be performed without error. To the contrary, variables measurement tasks are often confounded by human inspection error and/or instrument test error. The net result may be characterized in terms of bias and imprecision, where (1) bias is the difference between the true dimension of a unit of product and the average of a long series of repeated measurements on that unit, and (2) imprecision is the dispersion of repeated measurements on the same unit of product. This paper considers the design of variables acceptance sampling plans for a general lot distribution with known and constant variance and either an upper or lower specification limit. Bias, imprecision, and their combined effects on the operating characteristic curve are examined in detail and found to be quite significant. A method is then presented whereby the variables sampling plan may be designed to explicitly compensate for measurement error and provide the desired operating characteristic curve. An example problem is used to illustrate the important results of the paper. © 1975, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1975,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many Production Managers are faced with the problem of planning production, inventory and work force under the constraint of limited resources to meet a seasonal demand. Considerable research has been done on this planning problem and various models have been proposed. The linear decision rule (LDR), especially as applied to the well-known Paint Shop, represents a milestone in the development of such models and serves as a standard against which the performances of many other models are measured. A separable programming (SEP) approach is presented as an improved solution methodology for aggregate production planning. The LDR cost functions for the paint shop are approximated by piecewise linear segments. The results of this model are compared to various other planning models (e.g. linear programming (LP), goal programming and LDR models). In those cases where linearity of the cost functions of an undertaking may reasonably be assumed, an ordinary LP model suffices. In many cases, however, this simple linear approach to certain essentially non-linear cost functions is unacceptable due to the gross approximation made. Then SEP provides for an improved methodology without excessive formulation or solution effort. A close approximation of involved cost functions is possible simply by increasing the number of linear segments. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Implementation of flexible manufacturing technology in the batch manufacturing environment has created major problems for designers and engineers who are responsible for specification and design of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). The FMS design task appears to be an excellent application for expert systems techniques. This paper describes current results of an ongoing research effort to develop an expert system which analyses the output from an FMS simulation model, determines whether operational and financial objectives are met, identifies design deficiencies or opportunities for improvement, and proposes designs which overcome deficiencies or exploit improvement opportunities. An overview of the FMS design expert system is given and a case study is presented to illustrate how the system operates.

"This paper examines the order review/release (ORR) function and its impact on the operation of the shop floor. A source of disagreement between practitioners and researchers, ORR is an important element of any shop floor control system. This paper attempts to provide a better understanding of this element by presenting a framework for ORR. This framework not only identifies the important dimensions of ORR but also new dimensions for research. The paper also explores the relationship between ORR and job dispatching through a simple computer simulation model. The results indicate that the ORR, while reducing time spent in queue on the shop floor, does not always reduce the total time spent in the system. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Not long ago, industrial engineers moved to acquire more insight into the area of economic considerations in quality control. Contributions in this area fell into four basic categories: procedures for the economic selection of a quality level, procedures for the design of optimal sampling plans, procedures for the design of a sequence of sampling plans and procedures for process control. Since a satisfying literature review of this area cannot be found, this presentation is concerned with a taxonomy and descriptions of currently existing economically based quality assurance procedures. Major existing procedures are mentioned and current and future procedures are described in detail. The choice of the procedures for detailed examination is made both on the basis of the availability of information and with an aim to obtain an adequate coverage of approaches. The evaluation is in terms of: (a) Data requirement—how many different factors have to be measured and evaluated? What is the degree of difficulty of measuring and evaluating these factors? (b) Built-in assumptions—what stated and unstated assumptions are built into the procedures? (c) Usefulness of outputs—is the procedure directly applied within a context of production process by those in charge of the quality control function? (d) Versatility —can the model be used in different contexts or is it limited to one specific use? Among other things, the taxonomy analyses: data requirements, manual or computer programmes necessary to execute the calculation of different parameters, difficulty in updating, operator proficiency level, the costs that are taken into account and the possibility of using the procedure in the context of assemblies. © 1978, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1978,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Considerable attention has been given to the problems associated with acquiring and implementing many of the advanced manufacturing technologies currently available to firms. Much of the information being published, however, is based on individual experiences under conditions that are frequently not reported, as is common in the trade journals and public media. Fifteen such generally-accepted ‘postulates’ for managing factory automation are identified here and analysed in terms of five in-depth case studies involving advanced manufacturing systems. In a few cases, the postulates are rejected.

"The paper discusses planning problems which arise when different products are manufactured on several assembly lines and production has to be co-ordinated with other manufacturing centres. In a limited labour market flexible production capacity requires the transfer and retraining of existing workers. The first section of the paper explores the simplest possible planning element which still contains enough of the essence of the problems to shed some light on the nature of a solution, This model consists of the planning of production of a single product in one location, under the supposition that teams of girls may be relinquished to (or obtained from) a labour reservoir at a penalty which corresponds to retraining costs. A production planning game based on this model is constructed, and played with teams of human planners. The game is also played by means of two types of systematic decision rules: (.1) a linear production smoothing rule: (.2) the optimum rule for the game, developed by dynamic programming. This permits a comparison of the efficacy of human planners in comparison to automatic decision rules. The dynamic programming model is extended in the next part of the paper to cover a more realistic model of the situation. The results of the dynamic programming analysis are shown to be a very valuable tool for the production planning of several product types in one plant, as well as for the co-ordination of different plants. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1966,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Technological forecasting is located in technological space for a certain engineering domain and is the first step in the research and development of a new technology. There are many techniques already developed for technological forecasting like extrapolation of trends, heuristics forecasting by expert e.g. Delphi method. etc. The lnorphological method (MM) is used to describe a technique for identifying, indexing, counting and parametrizing the collection of all possible devices to achieve a specified functional capability. This is not a forecasting per se, but it is a useful organizing tool, a source of insights, and a starting point for further analysis by other methods, MilaEib (1976). In the paper we expand the capabilities of MM using artificial intelligence (AI) principles. The A1 production system has a global data base, a set of production rules and a control system. Special attention is paid to control strategv dex-eloping searching techniques in order to distinguish the explicit local knowledge about how to proceed toward a goal from any state from the implicit global knowledge of the complete solution.

"Some aspects, by a statistical approach, of the variation of the peak torque and mean cutting power encountered in gear hobbing are presented here. The cutting torque is measured by a purpose built strain gauge dynamometer and a wattmeter evaluates the power consumed. The problem is to determine whether a host of independent variables such as axial feed, module, material hardness, number of teeth in the gear blank and hobbing speed have a significant influence on the dependent variables, maximum cutting torque and average power. Mathematical models are constructed giving the relationship between these variables and the results indicate that the cutting speed has a significant influence on both the peak torque and average power.

"Earlier studies on production systems had indicated that the output is optimum when the less variable stages are loaded slightly more than the more variable stages. It is shown in this paper that this guideline is violated in systems consisting of a hyperexponential stage. From a comparative study of several two-stage systems it is shown that the unusual unbalancing behaviour of the hyperexponential distribution is due neither to its negative memory nor to any abnormality in the plot of its higher moments but to the fact that it is a composite distribution Considering a general two-stage system, in which each of the stages is composite to an arbitrary degree, it is shown that the mean cycle time of such a system can be written as a linear combination of the mean cycle times of the several sub-systems into which it can be decomposed. The unbalancing pattern of the overall system is shown to violate the conventional guideline because the component subsystems are in general grossly misbalanced when the overall system is notionally balanced. Exact expressions for the mean cycle time of two three-state systems (I: exponential-gamma-exponential and II: exponential-hyperexponential-exponential) are obtained by solving the integral equation for the distribution function of the residual time. From a comparative study of their unbalancing behaviour it is shown that the ‘composite stage effects play as dominant a role as the ‘bowl phenomenon’or the variability imbalance’. © 1985 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A production lot size model has been developed for an inventory system with deteriorating items. Both the varying and constant rate of deterioration have been included in the analysis. For the case of a varying rate, it seems impossible to obtain a simple expression for the production lot size, so a numerical method has been suggested. For the constant rate of deterioration case, an approximate expression has been derived for the production lot size. Finally, a numerical example is solved to show the impact of deterioration. © 1975, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1975,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A large percentage of industrial injuries are the result of performing manual materials handling (MMH) activities. Sometimes these injuries are due to inappropriate work practices, but very often due to the task demands. Such injuries, many of which are musculoskeletal, and the associated costs—workdays lost, reduced efficiency, compensation, etc.—have long been a concern to ergonomists. In this paper a procedure to evaluate and design MMH jobs is described. The generalized model structure utilizes the psychophysical approach. Data available in the published literature were used to develop models for determining work rates for the upper 90% of men and women in industry. Based upon the actual time duration, the model structure either evaluates a material handling job or provides guidelines for designing it.

"Surface finish data were generated for aluminium alloy 390, ductile cast iron, medium carbon leaded steel 10L45, medium carbon alloy steel 4130, and inconel 718 for a wide range of machining conditions defined by cutting speed, feed and tool nose radius. These data were used to develop surface finish prediction models, as a function of cutting speed, feed, and tool nose radius, for each individual metal. A general purpose surface finish prediction model is also proposed for ductile cast iron, medium carbon leaded steel, and alloy steel. Statistical analysis of experimental data indicated that surface finish is strongly influenced by the type of metal, speed and feed of cut, and tool nose radius. While the effects of feed and tool nose radius on surface finish were generally consistent for all materials, the effect of cutting speed was not. The surface finish improved with speed for ductile cast iron, medium carbon leaded steel, medium carbon alloy steel, and aluminium alloy, but it deteriorated with speed for inconel. Apparently, speed effect on surface finish is not always positive. For all metals, the surface finish improved with the tool nose radius while it deteriorated with speed. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Several lot sizing procedures for determining order points and order quantities have received attention in the literature. A few of these are as follows: Economic Order Quantity, Least Total Cost, Periodic Order Quantity, Lot for Lot, Part-Period Balancing, Silver-Meal algorithm, and the Wagner-Whitin algorithm. While some of the above procedures are relatively easy to compute (Economic Order Quantity, Least Total Cost, Periodic Order Quantity, Lot for Lot, etc.), others have experienced limited use in practice because of their computational complexities (e.g. Wagner-Whitin and Silver-Meal algorithms). This paper presents two lot sizing procedures that are easy to use.

"The paper describes experimental investigation into the internal broaching process and deals with three related sections. (i) The tendency of a broach to correct misalignments and surface irregularities of the pilot hole. Split workpieces, clamped in a special fixture for machining, enabled measurements and surface traces to be taken after drilling and after broaching. The effect of hole axis inclination, deliberately introduced at the time of drilling was examined. (ii) The tendency of a broach to drift in a transverse direction was studied by the use of composite workpieces built up of similar and dissimilar materials. (iii) Work on section (ii) showed that when broaching a composite workpiece of steel and brass more material was removed from the steel than the brass, i.e. the broach drifterd, transversely, towards the steel. To study this effect further, a broaching dynamometer was used to measure tangential and normal forces during the broaching of composite specimens. © 1971 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Today, the robot and robotics are the subject of countless publications. However, it is difficult to obtain a clear picture of reality when some praise the robot as the indispensable technological tool of the year 2000, and others attack it as a cause of unemployment and of other ills. Regardless of who is right and of examples of faultless applications such as those seen in the automobile industry, the development of robotics is much less rapid than experts had anticipated early in the 1980s. What are the reasons for this slowdown? Prohibitive costs, technological difficulties or organizational obstacles? The present paper covers the history of the implementation of a robotic installation in the steel industry in France (the firm where the actual study was conducted required anonymity). The authors attempt to analyse the positive, as well as the negative comments gleaned from the participants at the plant. Most of the difficulties encountered are related to the technological modifications required in the plant to install the robot and its peripheral equipment, as well as to labour and organizational changes which affected those most directly involved.

"We first discuss the characteristics of a general-purpose, user-oriented discrete event simulator for FMS. Then we briefly review the literature on scheduling rules for manufacturing systems. The performance of a number of dispatching rules is subsequently analysed using our modular simulator to mimic the operation of a real-life FMS. Results show that dispatching rules have a large impact on various system performance measures, such as average machine utilization. Considering the high investment costs of FMS it is certainly worthwhile to choose the best dispatching rule by use of simulation. This is especially true since modular and user-friendly simulators are now available so that the analysis can be performed quickly and at very moderate cost. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the arrival of programmes like CORELAP and CRAFT in the early sixties, a variety of aspects of this problem have been approached using computer technology.

"The following analysis determines the direction of the chip flow in free oblique cutting, based on the fact that the friction force on the tool face takes the direction of the relative motion of the chip along this face. This direction is shown to be one of minimum deviation of the material as it shears. The condition of minimum work yields a general expression for the shear angle. The dimensions of the chip action and the cutting forces are predicted by theory. An energy balance for oblique cutting is made. This general solution yields the well-known solutions of Merchant's model for orthogonal cutting as an obvious special case. © 1972 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A previous investigation proposed general definitions of some screw thread elements. Further study of one of these elements (the effective diameter equivalent of flank angle errors) has shown that certain ambiguity was left unexplained. This paper gives clarification and the choice already made is justified The new method for the determination of the effective diameter equivalent of flank angle errors for triangular parallel screw threads has been generalized to the complex case of taper screw threads When the results obtained are applied to some standard threads, certain appreciable divergencies are noticed It is expected that the results of this study will lead to more rational use of the effective diameter tolerances and may be exploited towards more accurate procedure of measurement of taper threaded elements. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1965,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Exact formulae of a general nature for the calculation of the effective diameter equivalent of flank angle errors for triangular screw threads with rounded roots and crests have been derived. The sign of individual flank angle errors has been taken into consideration, which lead to four possible cases of mating for each threaded element. Thus generalized formulae valid for all the cases of mating of a male or female element are deduced. Certain simplifications were introduced in the exact analysis which lead to a form more amenable for computation. Comparison of this latter form with other formulae in current use showed small divergences in the case of Whitworth threads but bigger divergences are expected in the case of threads with steeper flanks. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1964,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In the past the torsion test has been used in an attempt to correlate the deformation in metal forming and cutting operations with data obtained from a simple materials test. The success of these attempts has been variable. This paper reports on work carried out in an attempt to determine the optimum parameters associated with the torsion testing of thin walled tubes of short gauge length. The specimens were tested under conditions of pure torsion and torsion with an applied longitudinal load. The strain to fracture of the specimens was found to vary to a marked degree with specimen geometry and surface finish. The overall results from the paper allow the conclusion to be drawn that it is unlikely that the torsion test can be adequately used to simulate metal forming and cutting process, or at least, extreme care must be taken to ensure accurate results. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper presents a job scheduling problem. Two important aspects are included in the subsequent analysis. The first is the dynamic nature whereby new jobs arrive to be included intermittently through time. The second is the uncertainty, or error in estimating process times, and the likelihood of machine breakdown. An experiment is presented which shows the performance of a number of heuristics in the form of dispatching disciplines under different scheduling conditions which are determined by the scheduling period and the level of uncertainty in the process times and machine breakdowns. Various different measures of performance which could be of importance to management are considered. These include mean ratio of flow time to process time, mean queueing time, mean lateness, percentage of jobs late and net CPU times required to generate schedules in the simulation process. Results are presented showing the relationship between the performance of the heuristics relative to the different measures and the rescheduling period.

Furthermore, some ways of reducing the amplification by the ordering systems are also presented. The multi-stage ordering models discussed here are simplified, neglecting the characterist.ics of the single production systems which make up total multi-stage production systems and neglecting parameters concerning transportation and material flows.

A model, based on unpaced performance, is proposed for Type 2 pacing and predictions based on this model are compared with the experimental results from seven subjects. The effect on paced performance of varying the machine rate, the tolerance and of individual differences in operators are investigated The main findings of the research are that in Type 2 pacing: (1) it is possible to predict paced from unpaced performance with reasonable accuracy, (2) the effect of tolerance is critical, (3) unless tolerance is very large the rate of work which gives greatest output will be substantially less than the rate at which operatives will perform unpaced, (4) each operative has an optimum rate of work, running a machine above or below this rate will reduce output, (5) operatives should be very carefully selected and be well trained A progress report on the experiments, from which these findings are taken, will appear in the next issue of the Journal. © 1972 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Difficulties in defining fatigue have been recognized for many years; nevertheless, attempts are continually being made to give allowances for this nebulous phenomenon. Instead, attention should be directed towards the extent of the period of optimum performance, which is called the actile period. An operational description of the actile period is given. It is suggested that in light repetitive work the end of the actile period will be shown by an increase in variability— supporting evidence on self-paced, semi-paced and rigid-paced tasks is given. Organization of work so that a “pause” occurs at the end of the actile period will produce optimum performance. The nature of a “pause” is discussed. There will be an actile period also for non-repetitive work, although the nature of the indication of the end of the period in relation to specific jobs has still to be determined. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1961,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This experiment is the first or a series undertaken to test proposals put forward earlier by the first author that in repetitive work (i) output would be higher and variability less if breaks were given at the end of an actite period (period of optimum performance) rather than at the point when output decreased; (ii) the end of an actile period would be indicated by the onset of irregularity in performance which could be determined by the incidence longcycle times in unpaced work and an increase in the number of missed cycles in paced work; and (iii) the length of an actile period will depend on the demand made by the job and upon the capacity of the worker to meet the demand (her actility) Results from two subjects tested for a period of 3 1/2 months suggest that proposal (i) is correct. A condition in which two breaks were given at limes indicated by an increase in long times in unpaced performance gave a significantly better output and lower variance than a condition in which one break was given at a time indicated by a fall in output. Both subjects had relatively fewer misses in the paced condition when three breaks were given than when working continuously The technique for obtaining long times in unpaced work which formed part of (ii) was found to be practical and a simpler method was devised. The results obtained seem to confirm that the method has validity. No definite conclusions can be drawn on paced work. There is some tentative confirmation of (iii); in the paced condition the actile period seems to have been 1 hour compared with 1 1/4hours in the unpaced condition. Further, the better worker gave her best unpaced performance when rest was given after 1 1/4 hours whereas the less good worker did best when rest was given after 1 hour. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1963,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This study suggests a method evaluating the effectiveness of the individual work group, i.e. group effectiveness. In the design process it is very important to know what effectiveness we can expect from a proposed work group, and also when redesigning or reappraising a work group we must be able to evaluate the existing State of effectiveness. In either case the evaluation of group effectiveness is carried out through a procedure for ascertaining the goals for which the work group is designed. A special characteristic of our suggested method is that the group effectiveness is evaluated on the basis of configural patterns in multidimensional space. That is. each group member's response to effects is discriminated as an ‘effect-point’ in the multidimensional ‘effectiveness space’, which is formed by the use of a multidimensional scaling method, and then the relative effectiveness is assessed from the patterns of the effect-points in the effectiveness space. In order to appraise the existing state and estimate the design goals, the effectiveness must be related to the attributes of the work group. These relationships can he found from analyses employing ‘multidimensional classification methods’, i.e. M DC, CMDC-I, and CMDC-II. Thus the designer is able to predict effectiveness from the attributes of the proposed work group. In this paper we examine these relationships by the analysis of two indices of effectiveness (job satisfaction and work performance) and the attributes of the worker and task which are the critical elements for the design of an effective work group. We suggest a procedure to evaluate group effectiveness and identify the design goals. Our procedure will be applied to the design of more effective and better work groups. © 1984 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this paper the entity is defined as the constituent unit of the work group. Actually the entity means the individual worker, supervisor, or task. These entities have respectively their attributes and also contribute to the effectiveness of the design of the work group. Similar types of entities are constructed by considering the interrelations between attributes and effectiveness. The suggested MDC (multidimensional classification method) is a new method of classifying the entities in relation to the defined attribute space and effectiveness space and of better constructing similar types. From the viewpoint of the operationality of design and redesign of the work group, the MDC is useful to determine rationally the similar types of entities. In fact, in relation to job satisfaction, the similar task types could be successfully constructed by the use of the MDC. As a result, higher job satisfaction could be realized by manipulating the similar task types so determined. The similar types which are determined by the MDC are useful to create the design rules for manipulating the entities in the process of designing an effective work group. By determining the similar types of workers and supervisors and also adopting work performance and productivity as effectiveness indexes, the methodology can be established for designing an effective work group. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper addresses the problem of manufacturing cell formation, given multiple part routeings, and multiple functionally similar workcentres. Cellular manufacturing is intended to facilitate production, and thus should be based on projected production requirements. The originality of the approach lies in considering both the manufacturing system as well as projected production, and distributing the demand among alternate routeings in order to obtain a better manufacturing cell design. The suggested choice of part routeings favours the decomposition of the manufacturing system into manufacturing cells in a way that minimizes part traffic, along with satisfying the part demand and workcentre capacity constraints. We show that the problem can be formulated as a linear programming type problem which simultaneously addresses two problems: (i) routeing selection, and (ii) cell formation. The common objective is to minimize the inter-cell traffic in the system. The proposed algorithm iteratively solves two problems. The first problem is formulated as a linear-programming problem, while the latter is approached by an existing heuristic bottom-up aggregation procedure, known as Inter-Cell Traffic Minimization Method (ICTMM), enhanced appropriately. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper presents a case study documenting the development of an expert system for diagnosing the malfunctions of a machine used by the NEC Corporation to mount chips on integrated circuit boards. Development of the expert system was justified by the inability of operators to efficiently diagnose many malfunctions of the chip-mounting machine, the associated cost of production delays, and the disruption incurred when experts were forced to leave unrelated tasks to help operators troubleshoot malfunctions. The first step in development of the expert system was to elicit and organize the machine designer's knowledge. This process resulted in a hierarchical classification of malfunction symptoms and causes, a set of 15 flow diagrams documenting the designer's troubleshooting procedures for particular malfunction symptoms, and a matrix documenting design information. The flow diagrams were translated into a large logic network diagram, which was directly translated into a set of 94 rules. An additional set of 270 rules were derived from the design matrix. The resulting 364 rules were then implemented in an expert system using the KES shell. On-site validation revealed that 92% of the chip-mounting machine's malfunctions occurring in 1988-1989 were successfully diagnosed by the expert system. Future directions of this research will be oriented toward the development of a general purpose expert system capable of diagnosing the malfunctions of other similar production equipment. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this paper we investigate the problem of minimizing the mean flow time in a general job shop type machining system with alternative machine tool routeings. An analytical formulation of the problem as a mixed integer programming is developed. An efficient algorithm based on this formulation is developed to solve the problem by decomposing it into subproblems that are easier to solve. The algorithm solves large problems in relatively short time. A second algorithm based on the SPT rule is developed and its performance is compared with the first algorithm. A greedy procedure is also developed for the case when a penalty cost is associated with adding alternative machines. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the use of the above algorithms. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Traditionally, upon solution, independent demand inventory models result in the determination of a closed form for the economic lot size. Generally, this is obtained from the result that holding costs and setup costs are constant and equal at the optimum. However, the experience of the Japanese indicates that this need not be the case. Specifically, setup cost may be reduced by investing in reduced setup times resulting in smaller lot sizes and increased flexibility. Various authors have investigated the impact of such investment on classical lot sizing formulas which has resulted in the derivation of modified relationships. A common assumption of this research has been that demand and lead time are deterministic. This paper extends this previous work by considering the more realistic case of investing in decreasing setup costs where lead time is stochastic. Closed form relationships for optimal lot size, optimal setup cost, optimal total cost, etc. are derived. Numerical results are presented for cases where lead times follow uniform and normal distributions. Sensitivity analysis is performed to indicate under what conditions investment is warranted. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The assignment of n facilities to n locations, with the objective of minimizing the total cost of the design, is known as the facilities design problem. For a problem of size n there are n! feasible solutions, which can be represented by a frequency distribution of total costs. Recent statistical analyses have indicated that these distributions can be adequately described as gamma, and for many practical purposes the log normal or normal distributions give good approximations. The absolute mean of all the assignments can be easily calculated.For the assessment of the efficiencies of alternative layout designs, the knowledge of the standard deviation for total cost distributions associated with the facilities design problem is very useful to the facilities design engineer. A number of methods have been developed to compute the approximate value of the standard deviation from the basic data of flow and distance. This paper highlights the problem that such approximation may lead to a high level of errors. A computerized method for finding the exact value of the standard deviation has been presented. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Overhung boring bars of 10 to one overhang in the region of 38 mm diameter generally give rise to problems of poor surface finish and geometric form. The present work develops and extends that of Hahn (1951) and shows how improvements in performance may be obtained by modifying the construction of the boring bar. and choosing the optimum clearance fur a damper slug. The theory of the dynamic response of the damped bar is developed and an explanation is given of how the mechanism of damper behaviour changes as resonance is approached so that impacting is combined with viscous damping. The result of this combination, apparently, is to improve performance. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The expansion and contraction of product lines in a company is a decision which affects marketing, production, and distribution staff collectively. This paper establishes a model for a multi-factory company which markets a variety of products in different market sectors with different distribution costs. The problem is to determine how much of each product to manufacture at each factory, whether overtime should be used, how much expenditure to put into selling the product, and how it should be priced. Linear programming has already been used to tackle the product mix problem and this model extends it to include the marketing variables and the possible use of extra capacity. The objective is to make the annual product line plans to maximize total variable profit. The model is illustrated on a simple example. It is organized into a computer programme for accepting files of typical accounting data and providing a variety of management reports. © 1971 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper describes a, general model for planning work flow through a multiprocess production system and proposes a new practical scheme of control for scheduling. The features of the model are based on experience of a wide variety of industries and a means is considered for resolving the conflicts between different objectives such as meeting due dates and reducing work in progress. The control system presumes that only the inlet times of the jobs into the production system can actually be decided and managed by a production planner, and not the subsequent internal operation start times, as previous studies have often assumed. A method for optimizing the schedule is developed on the basis of this form of control and it is illustrated on a small example. Finally implementation factors and extensions are discussed. © 1971 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"For automatic robot programming, world modelling of the robot's environment is one of the most important phases of the task planning. World modelling requires that the robot know the environment in which it operates, including the spatial configuration of all objects in the task environment. In robotic assembly planning at the task level, representation of these objects requires symbolic feature and shape identification of the objects to be assembled by the robot. In this paper, we present a framework for reasoning about objects based on their shapes and features and the representation of such objects for robotic assembly planning when the modelling is done on a CAD system. We show the importance of AI languages in the communication of constructive solid geometry (CSG) based information from modellers. Finally, we present the schematic for a formalism, based on Prolog, for expressing object properties and assembly situations. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An automatic planning system for robotic assembly must have knowledge of the workspace. In particular it must be capable of reasoning about the shape of objects within the workspace. This requires a knowledge of object features and their behaviour in assembly situations. In this paper, a system is presented which extracts features relevant to assembly and machining from a boundary model derived from a Constructive Solid Geometry representation of a complex shape. In particular, finding concavities plays an important role in identifying possible mating features for assembly. These relevant features can then be used for assembly planning based on finding compatible sets of mating features. In this work the CAD data is extracted from a boundary model represented in an ASCII file and converted into the data-structures of the AI language, Prolog. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In all manufacturing and service industries the layout of facilities is an important determinant of operating efficiency and costs. Whenever the flow of materials or people is complex, computerized procedures offer the only feasible means of developing and evaluating alternative arrangements. This paper describes an interactive approach to construction and improvement procedures which utilizes a refresh graphics terminal (IMLAC)linked to a PRIME 400 computer. Input includes projected materials flow, estimates of material handling costs, 2-D templates of machines, etc., and an initial layout which can be either existing, proposed, or constructed using the procedure INLAYT. A heuristic procedure, S-ZAKY, utilizes multi-pairwise facility exchange to develop improved layouts based upon an analysis of materials flow. The improved layout is displayed in detail alongside the initial layout at the graphics terminal together with relevant material handling costs. The user may then accept, reject or modify the improved layout using the light-pen attached to the terminal before proceeding to successive iterations until satisfied. An economic evaluation of the projected savings in material handling costs against costs of relayout may be displayed at each iteration. On completion, a fully documented record including drawings may be obtained for every stage in the. procedure. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Single-sampling-attribute plans which make the producer's risk less than or equal to α (that is, ⩽ α) and the consumer's risk less than or equal to β (that is, ⩽β) are called exact sampling plans.

It, has been aiming at- developing an oil which gives a maximum cutting efficiency at a minimum wear rate of the tool and the guiding pads.The field trials included deep-hole machines of various sizes and makes, which were connected to a central oil-circulating system. The three major types of BTA tools (solid boring, trepanning and counterboring heads) of various sizes were used. (Jutting edges anti guiding pads were exclusively made of carbides of various grades.Materials at tempted in the trials ranged from mild carbon steel to high alloy, high-temperature strength, stainless and nitriding steels.A total of four experimental oil charges have been tested and each was broken up into a number of steps varying from five to eight. The fifth charge resulted from the observations on the previous four charges and was prepared for the iinal field test and eventual recommendation.The investigation was concluded with the recommendation of a new oil composition which subsequently was introduced commercially world wide. The main advantages of the oil as compared to any other tested composition are that it allows double or triple tool life, no wear of supporting pails, virtually no built- up edges, increased speeds and feed rates, high accuracy and better finish of bore surface. However, a longer period of testing time is required to investigate whether there is any additive depletion in the used oil which would account fora progressive drop in its performance. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This work deals with the measurement and analysis of torque and thrust in drilling mild steel using twist drills. Force and torque measurements were carried out using a specially designed two-component piezoelectric dynamometer. The dynamometer was both statically and dynamically calibrated, and techniques for increasing the measuring accuracy and reducing cross-interference were employed. Experiments have been carried out to measure the drilling torque and thrust in mild steel under different cutting conditions. Recorded data from the dynamometer were processed and an analysis was carried out to determine major statistical properties of the drilling torque and thrust. For each recorded cutting force signal, analyses were performed to determine the mean value, standard deviation, probability density, power spectral density and the autocorrelation function of the fluctuations in torque and thrust. Results of the above analysis show that the dynamic fluctuations of torque and thrust in drilling are stationary and random with Gaussian density function. An attempt has also been made to model the cutting torque and thrust in drilling mathematically, It is expected that this formulation will be useful in analysing the dynamic behaviour and stability of drilling machines. © 1979 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Recently, manufacturers of thermoplastic injection moulding machines have developed controllers with programmable velocity control. The speed of the ram can typically be varied in as many as ten zones during the injection process to establish a velocity profile. This velocity profile however, is determined by trial and error. Some controller manufacturers have made claims about injection velocity profiling, however, actual experimental data is not available to confirm them. In this paper, some experiments were conducted in order to verify the effectiveness of these claims. The results of these experiments indicate that injection velocity control has little effect on reducing or eliminating the problems for which the claims are made. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this work concentrates on the development process of special purpose machines used in metal-working industries, it is emphasized that the same methodology can be used for any other types of special purpose machines if the corresponding complexity variables are known.",1972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Search theory is concerned with the problem of locating a hidden object or target (a military target, a mineral deposit, a failed component in an equipment, etc.) with minimal cost or maximal probability subject to various practical constraints. The problem solution results in a plan or strategy of search, indicating where and in what sequence to look for the target. Koopman (1956) who pioneered the basis of the search theory states that ‘ search problems are more general than the problems of linear programming, since the expression to be optimized is nonlinear and involves integration ’. However, despite its generality and practical usefulness, almost all published material in the area emphasizes the theory which gives a false impression of the relevance of the available work to application. In this paper it has been shown that search models can be used for the solution of testing and inspection problems arising in industrial maintenance and quality control, Search models which can be used for this purpose have been introduced, for the first time, with a unified terminology and notation and classified in groups corresponding to problem constraints. As an application a real-life case problem and its computer solution have been provided. To encourage further applications the computer programme of the search model used for the solution of the case problem has been included. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although the technology exists for more advanced applications of automated guided vehicles in flexible manufacturing systems, the current employment of these vehicles in material handling generally subscribes to a simple mode of operation: single-load-carrying capacity for each vehicle and unidirectional traffic on each route of the system. Through a simulation programme, this study investigates the effect of several key factors related to the automated guided vehicles on the overall performance of a flexible manufacturing system. These are the number of pallets allowed in the system, the number of vehicles used and the carrying capacity of each and the input and output queue capacities of the machining stations; finally bidirectional traffic is allowed in some routes. The results show that there is a strong interaction among these factors and reveal their combined effects on the throughput from a small flexible manufacturing system. Upon the user's request, the simulation program also provides the animated colour graphics of the system to view developments concurrently under the selected decision values through time. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A numerical method for obtaining equilibrium performance measures for a single group of N identical machines, each subject to k(32) types of failures, is presented. The time intervals between breakdowns of a machine are exponentially distributed. The mean time between type i failures is Illi, i=1, 2. k. The service times required to repair any type of failure can be either deterministic, exponential, hypo-exponential, or hyper-exponential random variables, with different means for different types of failures. The service discipline is a non-preemptive fixed-priority rule, with different priorities assigned to different types of failures. System performance measures, such as average time spent by the machines waiting for service, average number of idle machines and machine operator utilization are obtained through imbedded Markov chain analysis. The algorithms used to obtain these measures exploit the special structure of the one-step transition probability matrix. The sensitivity of the performance measures to the density function of the service times and the priority assignments given is examined. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This paper outlines the development of a mathematical model for predicting the system reliability of the cutting tools for an automated machining system with various carbide inserts and sparw subject to Weibull failures. A numerical method using Simpson's Rule was selected as a method to address the problem of multiple integration resulting from the Weibull distribution in the spares model. A recursive algorithm was developed for predicting the system reliability of the cutting tools.

"There is no single concept of a manufacturing system covering all industries in every detail. It is necessary to examine the fundamental properties and characteristics of a range of systems and to consider the way they are synthesized and operated before consolidating general conclusions. What is seen depends very much on the viewpoint and the narrowness of the focusing range. Nevertheless there is much to be gained from a fundamental study of-all aspects of manufacturing systems and their interactions since there are opportunities for technology transfer between industries Manufacturing systems must be designed by taking into account both steady state and-dynamic performance, whilst ensuring there is an adequate number of controllable variables to compensate the effects of uncontrolled disturbances. The technological process part of the manufacturing system is synthesized from interacting unit-operation subsystems, and this itself is a subsystem of the overall business system. The business system has a complex multivariate nature and for its effective control it is important that information flows and plans or set points are well defined to allow people to be effective controllers of the system. System design and system control must be effectively integrated. © 1979, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The industrial robot, already an accepted element in modern manufacturing, when coupled with sensors and controlled by a computer, is better modelled as an operator than as a machine. In this paper the basic characteristics of sensor controlled robots are defined: workspace, actuation, positioning, orientation, sensing and decision making. Actual values of these characteristics are given for the Stanford Arm running under the WAVE system. In order to compare a robot to a human operator we consider each of the task elements defined in an established methodology for human work analysis, method time measurement (MTM). We translate each of these work elements into robot program statements. From this comparison we find that a robot can be modelled as an operator but that a different set of work elements is appropriate. We develop a new methodology, which we call RTM (robot time and motion) and describe an actual robot assembly operation. The same assembly task is described using MTM for a human operator as a comparison. RTM differs from MTM in that element times are based on physical parameters of the robot, maximum torque-, resolution, sensors, etc., leading to an exact method of predicting task times, unlike MTM which must take human variability into account in providing estimates of work element times. RTM provides a method of comparing robots by comparing work element times for each robot. A translation table from MTM into RTM is also developed, allowing robot performance to be compared to human operator performance for existing tasks. © 1979, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A simple technique for stabilization of the metal cutting process has been investigated. It was found when machining orthogonally on a tube with controlled contact tools that for a given feed per revolution there is a critical tool contact length below which instability will not occur irrespective of the width of cut. Further, it was found that the critical contact length was almost exactly proportional to feed. The threshold of unconditional stability for any feed can thus be defined in terms of controlled tool contact length. © 1975, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1975,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The contents of this paper show that when a metal toreion specimen is subjected to an axially applied compressive stress, then the resulting angle of twist recorded up to fracture will be greater than if tested under plain torsion conditions. Increasing this longitudinal compression results in a further increase in the fracture strain. The introduction of CCL4 to the gauge length whilst under test causes a reduction in the strain to failure. The presence of a longitudinal stress or CCL4 or a combination of both has little or no effect on the fracture strength of the tested materials.

Tests were conducted with this method on a milling machine and a lathe A variant of the method was later developed, “through the tool” radio frequency resistance heating. By using the tool as one of the electrodes, feeding the current in through the chip and removing it below the cutter by a sliding contact, very localised heating was obtained.

"The process variability with respect to surface roughness as measured by Rα and -Rmax values in single point oblique finish turning of a carbon steel is systematically studied on a statistical basis throughout the life of the tool. Thus, firstly, the effect of tool wear on surface roughness is considered. Furthermore, cumulative distributions of Rα and -Rmax values are presented to illustrate how well the observed data fits the theoretical. A x2 statistical test of significance was applied to test the normality of these distributions. Normality was established for all distributions dealt with mostly at 5% significance level.

"The selection of economically optimal machining rate variables, i.e. cutting speed and feed rate, is of major importance in the field of metal cutting. In this paper, apart from the conventional methods used for optimization in machining economics, geometric programming, a relatively new non-linear programming technique, is employed to optimize the constrained unit cost problem in turning. The cutting power available from the machine tool and the permissible CLA value of surface roughness are used as the forced constraints in the primal programme. Initially, the primal and dual programmes are formulated. Furthermore, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the application of geometric programming which has been proved successful. It is pointed out that geometric programming may be also used for optimization of unit cost in machining processes other than turning under the assumption that the imposed restrictions, discussed in this paper, are valid. © 1973 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An essential condition necessary for the implementation of the Japanese just-in-time (JIT) technique with Kanbans is Small setup times relative to processing times. Without this condition bottlenecks occur at workcentres which delay production. However, the Japanese have developed a variation of the strict JIT technique that employs a special type of Kanban, referred to as a ‘signal Kanban’, at workcentres with relatively high setup times. While a normal Kanban triggers the production of larger than normal lots this altered version of the JIT technique provides an alternative approach for firms that desire to use the JIT technique, but are unable to reduce setup times at all workstations. The purpose of this paper is to describe the signal Kanban technique and demonstrate two versions of an integer mathematical programming approach for determining the optimal lotsizes to be used in conjunction with signal Kanbans. A simulation model is subsequently employed to test the effectiveness of the integer programming models and to explore some of the characteristics and conditions a firm might encounter when implementing a JIT system. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Japanese production environments exhibit a number of characteristics not present in many American firms that contribute to the success of the just-in-time (JIT) system with Kanbans. However, because of the advantages of a JIT system with Kanbans many firms have attempted implementation without the existence of the appropriate production environment to do so. The purpose of this paper is first to identify those factors that will influence the number of Kanbans required at a workcentre for the production manager implementing a JIT system in an uniquely American production environment. The factors that will be identified include the throughput velocity (i.e. the rate at which items flow through a workcentre machine), the coefficient of variation in processing times (i.e. the degree of variability of processing times), the machine utilization (i.e. the availability of slack time on a machine), and, autocorrelation of processing times (the degree to which successive processing times on a specific machine are related to each other). For example, considering just one of these factors, the coefficient of variation, it is demonstrated for a sample shop that reducing the coefficient of variation by a factor of three will reduce the number of Kanbans required by a factor of six. This type of analysis of these factors by the potential Kanban user can provide the user with some insight into the viability of a Kanban-tvpe system for a particular shop. The impact of these factors will be analysed via simulation. The second part of the paper will describe a methodology for determining the number of Kanbans to use at a workcentre given a dynamic production environment. This methodology will also be demonstrated via simulation. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It has long been known that a product-type plant layout produces maximum economy both in production time and materials handling provided there is sufficient volume to justify tying up equipment in special-purpose functions. Acceptance of the idea of continual relocation of production machinery as required by the changes in products appears to offer a means of extending the economies of the “production line” into situations previously considered only for “job” shop operations. Mounting machinery on special bases enables their being moved by fork lift, crane or air cushions at proper times and to proper location to minimize materials handling and in effect create transitory production lines. A computer program called Flex Flow has been devised to schedule such operations using the input from planning of new jobs plus feedback of actual operations from the mill. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1966,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The purpose of this paper is to illustrate a new technique useful in modelling complex production systems—GERT network analysis.

"Unreliable work stations are examined and decision rules are established for the interruption of operation before a breakdown occurs. These rules depend upon the risk assessment by the user, the state of the station, and its probabilistic characteristics. The state of the station is registered by some mechanism and is represented by a finite field of events. After the decision rules have been established, series and parallel networks of stations are considered and expected production and throughput rates are computed. The expected throughput rates depend on the decision made, as well as the probabilistic nature of the repair effort. © 1984 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We have developed an event-driven algorithm for simulating a factory production line with storage. Using this algorithm a production line, with an arbitrary number of machines each processing items at different rates and with buffers of any size, can be modelled efficiently. The algorithm is based on computing the time to the next event for each buffer and machine, where the events are: a buffer becomes full, a buffer becomes empty, a machine fails and a machine is repaired. By collapsing the production line to exclude empty buffers that stay empty and full buffers that stay full, piece-by-piece computation is avoided. Computation time is reduced further by updating a buffer only when the input or output rate of that buffer changes or when the state of that buffer changes. The implementation of this model is compared to a piece-by-piece simulator. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The London School of Economics have, since 1959, studied the jobs of supervisors in a number of plants to demonstrate their range and variety and the relation of supervisory systems to technology. A previous article (see below) on the first part of the research argued that there was no straightforward relationship between the two, but that organizational and human factors could also greatly determine supervisory jobs. This paper describes the last part of the research which was devoted to a far deeper and more detailed analysis of supervisory jobs in one large firm in an attempt to find more concrete evidence of different influences on supervisory jobs. The results show that the nature of the product, the technical situation, the factory organization, the supervisory training programme and the supervisor's personality all affected both his behaviour and the demands made on him. A supervisor was seen to be reacting to a continuous succession of pressures, some of which ran counter to others. The relative weighting of these against each other, as well as the supervisor's personality, affected the way in which he behaved as well as the subsequent demands made on his job. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1964,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A critical assumption in balancing assembly lines is that the line is ‘ serial ’ with no ‘ paralleling’ of tasks allowed. This constrains the cycle time to be at least equal to the maximum task time, which in turn limits the production rate. One alternative to increasing the production rate (hence lowering the cycle time) is by allowing parallel tasks in the assembly line at the cost of additional facilities. In this case, the problem becomes one of selecting the tasks to be paralleled such that the total cost is minimized. This problem is formulated as a mixed integer programme, and a branch and bound algorithm is presented for its solution. The structural properties of this programming problem are discussed, which con be used to improve the computational efficiency of our branch and bound algorithm.

"All recent improvements of significance in manufacturing operations have involved substantial reductions in production cycle times. The outstanding successes of Just-In-Time strategies are due primarily to much quicker deliveries from suppliers, shorter fabrication and assembly times and faster shipments to customers. Accelerating rates of change in product design and process technologies, coupled with more rapid market fluctuations and shorter product life cycles have spelled doom for many manufacturing companies unable to react promptly. Giants in trouble like General Motors show that no one is immune. A principal fallacy limiting the success of many companies, even those with fine modern computer-based planning and control systems, has been the strong belief that such systems can work well with any lead times.

"The purpose of this paper is to define conceptually and operationally, a measure of quality density in manufacturing. This is expressed in terms of a manufacturing process propensity to ‘output’ units which are defectives, as a function of the manufactured production output, the manufacturing deterioration process, maintenance, quality control, and generally the risks a manufacturing process is subjugated to. Particularly, we assume that the production process induces ‘shocks’ which lead to poorer manufactured quality, while maintenance efforts are continually being employed to restore the process propensity to produce units of better quality. Quality control is used then to monitor the output quality of units produced. Using a methodology of level crossing in stochastic point processes, the stationary probability distribution of a manufactured output quality is defined. Applications to production quality management, combined quality and maintenance management, as well as quality control are considered. Finally, an exponential shock model is resolved analytically. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The macroproduction model is a general management appreciation of the production function. A set of perspectives is integrated to define structural stability. The basic assumption is a relationship between the flow of work and the flow of money, leading towards a ‘first and second law of production dynamics’. The overall production function is defined in terms of levels of structure and structural stability. © 1984 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper attempts to bridge the gap between where economic theory leaves the concept of the production function and where the pragmatic production manager stands, devoid of an adequate theoretical understanding of the multivariate, compounding set of real-time factors associated with manufacturing systems. The mathematical approach has been changed from calculus to topology in an attempt to provide a more visual vehicle for everyday use. Essentially the topological building block is a three-dimensional vector space which is used to model both the microeconomic and the microproduction function. As the number of dimensions in the model increases to match practical needs, so a new method of defining the production function was evolved. © 1984 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Theoretical analysis of anodic smoothing in electrochemical machining (ECM) is presented. Modifications are suggested to the existing mathematical models. Modifications lead to simpler expressions compared to the more rigorous analysis considering polarization effects. Experimental verification of the behavior of short wavelength irregularities using mild steel anode in sodium chloride electrolyte is reported. Modified theory is in closer agreement with the experimental results obtained with rectangular, vee and concave irregularities of short wavelengths.

"Milling is one of the most widely used metal removal processes. The number of decision parameters involved in the milling operation makes the experimental estimation of tool life equations very dimcult. Optimal metal removal rate has been modelled independently of the cutter path selected for the operation. However, the choosing of the proper cutter path might significantly reduce the total tool travel and therefore also reduce the tool wear due to the reduction in the tool engagement with the job With the widespread application of robotics in industry, robots are also being used to automate the grinding process. Robotized grinding of flat polygonal surfaces is one such application where the tool path is similar to face milling of like surfaces. Thus optimizing the total tool path during NC face milling/robotized grinding remains an important problem A mathematical model representing the total tool path on an N-sided convex polygonal surface has been developed. The stair-case type of tool path has been considered. The resulting formulation is complex and cannot be solved using standard analytic or numeric methods. An algorithm has been proposed to find an optimal solution using the above model, by enumerating over tool sweep angles between 0° and 180°. This algorithm can be easily coded and run on a PC. Finally a detailed example is given explaining the application of this algorithm. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The research on lot sizing is extensive; however, no author in the literature reviewed to date provides an optimal solution algorithm to a prevalent problem which is found in manufacturing. A multi-level, general product-structure, variable-cost model is presented which follows the procedure of a closed-loop material requirements planning (MRP) system, and incorporates many conditions that production and material managers find in practice. A branch and bound (BandB7) algorithm is developed. The efficiency of BandB is derived from effective lower bounds and solution procedures which are determined on the basis of the space-time structure of the MRP lot-sizing problem and its non-convex total-cost function. This path-dependent lower bound is computationally efficient and guarantees an optimal solution. The BandB algorithm is tested on problems and compared to heuristics in the literature. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The deterministic job-shop scheduling problem exhibits the fundamental computational difficulty implicit in determining an optimal timetable for sharing production resources among competing production activities. While adaptation of the formal model to industrial practice is fraught with difficulties, we show that the underlying binary-disjunctive formulation itself is more robust than might be immediately apparent. Straightforward extensions of the underlying model are sufficient to capture such practical problem features as assembly and disassembly sequences, due-dates and out-processing operations, scheduled maintenance, nonzero release times and dispatch operations, certain sequence-dependent set-ups and materials handling delays, and a great range of operational side-constraints. Technological sequences need not be total orders, job priorities can be assigned explicitly or implicitly, and any regular measure of performance can be represented. The principal structural limitation is that machining sequences must represent total orders over component operations to preserve the model form. For this reason, concurrent or parallel processing (as in machining centres or cells) and indefinite cyclical process flows (as are sometimes required for rework) cannot be modelled directly. An example problem is provided which illustrates these extensions and an industrial application employing the extended model is briefly considered. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In planning production or new plants it is necessary to pre-calculate exactly the required number of operators and their equipment and machine tools. Such data are used also in calculating the efficiency of technical equipment and types of buildings required by new plant. It is seldom possible to use data based on experience gained from the former course of production, for normally the aim of replanning is to alter these conditions. Therefore, data are needed on time requirements at the different work-places. These.data have to indicate the influence of any alteration in the workplace. Such standards on time requirements can only be derived from work experiments. As agriculture proves, even standards concerning complicated operations can be fixed in advance and can be varied exactly with the planned project. In general, standards concern smaller parts of an operation, but they can also be summed up to give times for complete operations or even complete production plans when listed in catalogues. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1967,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Current research in cutting tool technology is based on absorption costing; within this paper however, this is shown to be an incorrect technique to use. When variable costing, together with DCF, is correctly used, the traditional assumptions which typically result in a 15 minute tool life are found to be erroneous, with the optimum cutting conditions being markedly different from those recommended within existing literature. It is also demonstrated that by using a correct financial methodology, the viability ·of advance processes such as CNC and FMS are improved because the cutting conditions for such machines should differ greatly from those for inexpensive machine tools. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper introduces an optimization algorithm for finding the sequence of stock sheets to use in a two-dimensional bill-of-materials layout problem, when there is more than one size of stock sheet to choose from and when the method for laying each single sheet is already chosen. To reduce computer time and memory requirements for solving this problem, two other heuristic approaches are also proposed. Tests on data from a Wisconsin manufacturer show that the use of multiple sheet sizes can materially reduce the trim losses achieved from a layout system that uses only a single sheet size. The heuristic methods introduced represent progressive stages in the trade-off between layout quality and the computer time and memory required to achieve the layout. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Multiple objective models have frequently been proposed to assist in solving aggregate production planning problems. Although such models are an improvement over those with single objectives, demand is usually considered deterministic. For this reason, previous attempts at solving production problems have often lacked realism and could not be successfully applied in many real decision environments. This paper suggests a chance-constrained goal programming (CCGP) approach to production planning which allows the decision maker to specify both probabilistic product demands and production line operating characteristics more in keeping with actual situations. The CCGP approach is based on the sequential solution of a linear programming formulation, allowing efficient solution of large-scale real-world problems using commercially available LP codes. The procedure is demonstrated with a hypothetical example, and proper interpretation of goal achievement is discussed. The findings in the paper are applicable whether preemptive goal programming or a weighted objective function approach is used. © 1984 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"‘ Bowl phenomenon ’ refers to the increase in production rate obtained by unbalancing a series production system such that the service time increases progressively on either side of the central stage(s). While such a result is valid for production systems with otherwise identical stages, earlier studies have suggested that a different effect may come into play when the stages of the system differ in their variability. In the simplest case of n two-stage system, production rate could be improved by shifting a part of the work load from the more variable stage to the less variable one. From an analysis of three-stage systems with all possible combinations of exponential and deterministic stages, it is shown in the present paper that optimum unbalancing results from a superposition of these two effects. This loads in some cases to a large improvement in the production rate. For the large differences in coefficients of variation considered in this paper, the ‘ variability imbalance ’ clearly plays a decisive role and outweighs the ‘ bowl phenomenon ’ when they act in opposing directions. For a three-stage system with a uniform stage sandwiched between two exponential stages, it is shown that the two effects exactly cancel one another when the coefficient of variation of the central stage is nearly 05. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Analytical solutions for the mean cycle time of a two-stage series production system with variable operation times at the stages are presented. Although the methodology is applicable to any type of service time distribution at the stages, typical cases of Erlang and normal distributions are worked out in detail. It is shown that the problem of a multi-stage unpaced belt production system can, in principle, be reduced to one of integration, for arbitrary service time distributions at the stages. Detailed expressions are obtained for the mean cycle time and in process inventory of a two-stage series production system with provision for an arbitrary level of interstage inventory. The service time at one of the stages is assumed to be constant and the other distributed exponentially. The analysis leads to the conclusion that at high values of coefficient of variation, the type of service time distribution has a considerable effect on the overall throughput of the system and unbalancing has a favourable effect on the efficiency of a two-stage series system when the variability of service times at the stages is not the same. © 1975, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1975,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Several imperfect inspection operations are available in a discrete production environment. A decision regarding acceptance or rejection of the produced items needs to be made without exceeding specified limits for the probabilities of accepted units being non-conforming and rejected units conforming to quality specifications. A branch and bound approach is used to find the inspection sequence resulting in least expected total inspection cost. Following the heuristic construction of a trial solution, a dominance relationship is applied to search the tree of possible sequences for the optimal sequence.

"Japanese production methods and operational control techniques have been the subject of much recent attention from American production managers and the media. In this paper the Kanban aspect of the 'just-in-time' concept is analysed in order to ascertain the potential for scheduling in an ill-structured production operation and to compare its effectiveness with the traditional MRP lot-for-lot scheduling and control procedure. The analysis will be conducted using a hypothetical production operation that includes multiple workcentres, machines and product structures, and serial and assembly operations. Simulation model results are discussed and principles for selecting the more cost-effective system are outlined for the general MRP lot-for-lot versus Kanban scenarios. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The application of probabilistic models, utilizing the concepts of delay and the individual work station, offers a basis for realistic analysis and design of materials handling conveyors. These models, used in conjunction with the usual economic analyses, provide an improved means of describing the performance of a conveyor and the stations located along it Mathematical models provide the expected delay resulting when loading or unloading a conveyor at a particular work station. The models were developed in segments by considering a loading range, a bank removal range, and a reserve replenishment range. The availability of three distinct ranges provides for easier adaptation of the models to a given practical situation In addition to the delay models, probabilistic expressions for the finished product bank and raw material reserve are provided. © 1972 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper introduces a network How method for manpower scheduling and resource allocation. The network formulation of the problem permits the development of an algorithm that determines the minimal flow of resources through the network. The method presented here corresponds to the Simplex method, for in both methods the value of the objective function is optimized while the capacity limitations are preserved. The procedure proposed here, however, uses a more economical problem representation, and is computationally more efficient. The efficacy of the minimal flow algorithm and its use is illustrated fora production system but. the applicability of the procedure is sufficiently broad for it to work in other problem situations just as well. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper develops a procedure for locating profit maximizing operating conditions when the input variables are subject to control by the experimenter and observations on physical output may be taken subject to experimental error at any combination of these inputs. This procedure uses the Box-Wilson technique, a well-known statistical search procedure, together with the price of the output and the cost of the inputs so as to search for maximum profit points rather than maximum output points. The result is an experimental search method which maximizes profit when the functional form of the physical response surface (production function) is unknown. In this case, of course, standard mathematical programming models are of no use in the absence of the required functional forms. This functional form, though unknown, is determined by the existing investment in capital equipment. hese procedures, like the Box-Wilson technique, are more likely to be applicable to flow process reactor systems in the chemical and oil industries, but are certainly not limited to such applications. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1965,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These improvements are evidenced by increased time spent with the patient rather than on other duties. A problem, so far unresolved, arises with the need to change the allocation of nurses to patients at certain times.

"This paper is concerned with the operational control problems in Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) with limited local buffers. Three new process selection rules which can be applied to the FMS with limited local buffers and can flexibly cope with the change of system configuration (machine breakdown, etc.) are developed. In addition, AGV dispatching and AGC route selection rules are also developed for the simultaneous scheduling of jobs and material handling devices. The three new process selection rules (ARD, ARP and ARPD) are then compared with two existing rules (NAR and WINQ) by simulation experiments. The simulation experiments include the six operational control sub-problems for jobs and AG Vs. The multi-criteria performance measures considered simultaneously are makespan, mean flowtime, mean tardiness, maximum tardiness, and system utilization. The simulation results indicate that ARD gives the best results in four performance measures except for system utilization. Secondly, ARD, ARPD and WINQ rules give significantly better results than ARP and NAR rules in every performance measure. Thirdly, as the production requirements are increased, the differences between [ARD, ARPD, WINQ] and [ARP, NAR] are more significant. Fourthly, the local buffer capacity level of 5 (= 5) shows the better results for all the performance measures than the capacity level of 3 (q = 3). © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Relative performance of decision rules for specific production and inventory control problems has gained attention in the last two decades. One of these areas receiving attention is MRP nervousness. Generally, the issue of MRP nervousness has been examined under highly simplified environments for single decision rule effects. Implications of the results of these previous studies may be misleading in light of interaction effects with different decision rules. Conclusions drawn may not be appropriate when interactions of decision rules are considered under more realistic environments. Statistical interactions have been found and reported (Minifie and Heard 19S5).

"The typical factory automation system contains a number of programmable automation devices such as robots, automatic storage/retrieval systems (AS/RSs) and automatically guided vehicles (AGVs). Real-time control system software (RTCS) is needed for integrating these devices into a synchronized manufacturing system (SMS). However, development of this RTCS software could be hampered by excessively long software development backlogs which are currently averaging about 30 months in the typical US corporation. This paper presents a structured methodology for the development of the specifications for such software. This methodology is illustrated by applying it to an automated system for producing highway traffic signs. This system consists of an assembly robot with an automatic tool changer, an AS/RS and a reciprocating table. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It has been suggested that the efficiency and economics of a flexible manufacturing system can be improved through judicious grouping of machines and parts. This paper addresses the formulation of families of parts requiring similar manufacturing with closely related machines using the topological concepts of polyhedral dynamics (i.e. ^-analysis).An introduction to the concepts of^-analysis is presented and is followed by a discussion of the application to machine-part group formation. Two examples from the literature are presented and the resulting part groupings compared. The results suggest that ^-analysis not only provides part grouping capabilities equivalent to current techniques, but also provides additional qualitative information. Measures are available which provide insight into the importance of particular groupings and the strength of the interaction between the groups. The analysis also identifies machines with are potential bottlenecks, and parts whose availability may impact the manufacturing process. A measure is also available for comparing various flexible manufacturing system options in terms of process stability or controllability through a qualitative estimate of system complexity. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Firms can handle defects that occur on an assembly line in a number of different ways. Traditionally, defective units were either scrapped or sent to a separate repair station. With the advent of Japanese production methodology in the US, line-stop buttons were introduced to assembly lines; when a defect was discovered, the assembly line was stopped and the defect was repaired immediately (on-line repair). We develop a relatively simple model of the assembly line to compare these alternate strategies and derive some qualitative insights into this problem. Our primary performance measures are the production throughput rate, the work-in-process inventory level (WIP), and the field defect rate. We use both queuing theory and simulation to estimate these measures for the different strategies Of course, not all defects can be detected. The presence of imperfect inspection complicates the analysis, requiring us to determine values for probabilities of defects and inspection errors that are consistent with the factory that gave rise to this investigation Two standard advantages of on-line repair are faster on-the-spot repairs and a heightened awareness of the consequences of defects, resulting in a drop in the defect rate. But even after adjusting for the advantages, we find that in many instances online repair results in a lower throughput rate than the traditional off-line repair shop. The most effective strategy subdivides the production line and uses WIP buffers between the segments to limit the propagation of line stoppages. Adding small amounts of WIP substantially increases the output of the production line. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In this paper a problem of multi-item production on a single facility is being dealt with. The facility is an electrochemical machining (ECM) system and the products are impact sockets of various sizes for power wrenches. Sequencing production lots in a certain order minimizes set-up time for each new production lot. However, as demand differs from item to item, it is not essential to produce each item in every production cycle. A grouping procedure of the various items is adopted. A modified version of the Page and Paul algorithm is then applied to insure production cycle times which are multiples of the shortest production cycle time.

"The potential performance of two different ways of designing truck assembly systems, namely line and dock assembly, are analysed. The line system denotes assern bly at a mechanically paced moving belt with fixed items, divided in several one-worker stations with a common station time around 20 minutes and located in parallel with up to three other stat.ions, The dock system denotes assembly at stations with typical station times around 4 hours; the items are moved between stations by the workers, who are divided in groups of around ten persons assembling complete trucks. Theoretical models for these specific systems are presented, which together with the results are applicable to more general situations. The net and gross work times are derived for line and dock assembly, where net work time denotes time when work is done and gross work time is net plus lost work time. The potential efficiencies are expressed as the quotient between the net and gross time. The models are analytic and based partly upon published and partly on new models and hypotheses of human behaviour. Adifference hetween the gross work times of around 30% is obtained in favour of dock assembly, when data from the literature and an existing line are used. Experiments support this result. A maximum work speed consistent with personal comfort and safety for eaohjndividual and a rational cooperation between the group members are assumed. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cermets are a fairly recent entry in the growing list of commercial cutting tool materials and their behaviour and wear characteristics are being extensively studied and tested. This project was aimed at understanding the failure mechanisms of three brands of commercially available Cermet cutting tool inserts. Scanning electron microscopy assisted by chemical analysis was used to study the inserts as received and after being used to machine two different kinds of steel bars in turning operations. The turning operations for every work piece material were conducted at both high and low rates of metal removal (4'86 and 1·50in.3/min respectively). The metallurgical diagnosis showed different dominating characteristics for each of the inserts while the analysis of the failure mechanisms exhibited varied wear resistance patterns for each Cermet/work material combination. This variability is believed to be due not only to the different properties of the tools but also to the unique interaction of each tool material/work material combination. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The COVERT job shop dispatching rule was tested extensively twenty years ago with impressive results, however, since then it has been included in only one comparative analysis with other sequencing rules, and, reported instances of its application have been infrequent. In this paper, the COVERT rule is examined in detail relative to its applicability, its sensitivity to various operating parameters and performance measures, and its performance compared to several other sequencing rules including truncated SPT rules, dynamic slack rules and modified duedate rules. The performance of COVERT is examined for a variety of tardiness measures. The examination is conducted within the context of a simulation model of a machine-constrained job shop with serial jobs and random routings. The results indicate that COVERT performs well as a sequencing rule and in most instances was superior to the other sequencing rules tested both directly and across varying degrees of due-date tightness. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The interfacing of computer-aided design (CAD) to computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) is a vital step in automated manufacturing. An essential operation is the recognition of features from the part design. This paper presents a methodology for the recognition of features from two-dimensional rotational objects. First, this work defines the term ‘feature’ as a set of connected lines in the profile of the object, which satisfy certain geometric properties. Then, the task of feature recognition is decomposed into a set of distinct functions. These recognize, classify, decompose and reconstruct, and identify face sets which satisfy the definition of features. A prototype is developed which implements these functions. The important characteristics of this methodology are: (1) all cylindrical features are recognized, and most of them identified according to the input formats of a desired CAPP system; and (2) the system is modular and flexible and its functions can be easily modified. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In studying the activities of 274 shop floor hourly operators during a period of 16 months, the evidence indicates that during a period of equitable payment system the number of grievances decreased 31 times, labour turnover 16 times, lateness 6 times and absenteeism nearly 3 times while at the same time productivity increased by 22% in comparison to an equivalent period of inequitable financial incentive payment system.

"The one-bole test was developed to provide a situation in which unlike that in the Purdue peghoard and similar teste, the reach, grasp, move and position elements were consistent and their rate of improvement measurable. Results support the hypothesis tlmt measurements of rate of learning or of performance after 600 cycles of practice have a higher concurrent and predictive validity of production output than measurements of initial performance on the test. The one-hole test has a mean predictive validity of 0-75 (N = 228) between test scores and rate of learning in the training school; and a mean concurrent validity of 0-66 (N = 307) between test scores and mean production performance of experienced operators. Norms (N = 1422), reliabilities (W=158) and correlation of the one-hole test scores with anthropometric measurements, personality, intelligence, age and other manual dexterity tests are discussed. © 1975, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1975,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result of the limitations inherent in the present technique of estimating work standards, the concept of utilizing psychological and physiological indices instead of time alone in establishing predetermined work standards is evaluated in an exploratory study. Experiments were conducted on 15 male subjects on a transport and position type repetitive task. The operation was performed single-handedly and with simultaneous motions for over 1000 cycles per subject per condition. Results indicate that: (1)Physiological performance improved with practice of the designated manual task. (2)The energy expenditure per cycle for the preferred and non-preferred hand motions is not significantly different from that required in simultaneous motions. (3)The indication that energy expenditure of simultaneous hand motions is not significantly different from that of single-hand motions supports the classical claims, put forth by neurophysiologists, that the sum of the individual time elements does not equal the time of the whole motion patterns. This encourages the possibility of being able to establish predetermined work standards using physiological indices instead of time. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The paper reports on two empirical studies into the relationship between a companys sales and its inventories. Two ideas are examined. Firstly,are there economies of scale in the holding of inventories, do large companies hold proportionately lower levels than smaller companies? Secondly,has there been a significant change in the inventory-sales relationship over time,has the increasing emphasis on scientific management led to a change in inventory holding practices? As well as answering these two points,the paper illustrates the difficulties of working with aggregate company data,supplied only once a year.

"The analytical procedure of predetermined motion time systems is based on the premise that time standards can be determined by adding elemental times, fixed once and for all and conceived as universally applicable. Consequently, it was the aim of the experiments to investigate whether this “additivity of elemental times” can be considered sufficiently accurate in practice. Experiments proved that influences exist, due to the effect of the motion “Gestalt”, which make the presumed additivity of elemental times questionable. However, it is also demonstrated—at least as far as the experiments reported are concerned—that, on the one hand, it appears impossible to allow for such influences in practice since they vary from one person to the next, and that on the other these influences may be considered, in many cases, to be of little significance in relation to other factors. Finally, some general theoretical considerations concerning the overall accuracy of the predetermined motion time systems are presented. From the curves developed it is suggested that even greater inaccuracies in the elemental times will, in many cases, lead to total times of satisfactory validity. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1967,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We propose a heuristic procedure that constructs a schedule for N unit jobs with arbitrary precedence on m identical processors in parallel. The criterion is the minimization of the total weighted completion times. The procedure translates the optimal solution on one processor into a solution on the m-processors. Two bounds on the worst-ease performance of the procedure are derived, with the second being the stronger of the two, but at the expense of requiring slightly more computing effort. In view of the fact that the one-processor solutions may be hard to obtain, the proposed heuristic is applied to one processor near optimal solutions and the experimental results presented indicate that the heuristic performs equally well. © 1984 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Ideally the just-in-time (pull system) production system holds no buffer inventory so that the production is ‘just in time’. This is achieved only when the stage's operation times are constant and equal; but realistically the variability of operator performance and/or the unequal distribution of task times precludes such an ideal situation. As a result, the production line experiences problems. In this paper we investigate the effects of these variabilities on the performance of push and pull systems and how the manager can decide which production technique to adopt.

"Ideally a production line is perfectly balanced and most efficient when all the stages have been allocated an equal amount of task times, but realistically this situation is almost impossible for a practical problem. For such an ideal situation, the just-in-time (pull system) production system holds no inventory in between the stages, such that the production process is just-in-time. The stage operation limes are random variables and the mean of each operation time has been assumed deterministic in sampling from a group of different mean operation times. Thus, because of the differences in stage operation times due to the variability of the operator's performance and/or unequal distribution of task times, the production line experiences various types of problems. In this paper we tried to see the effects of this imbalance of stage operation times in a just-in-time (JIT) production system. In addition to the implications of the simulation results, an indication for further research has been given in the conclusion. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper describes a generalized heuristic to balance an assembly line where the task times may be smaller or greater than the specified cycle time. The tasks are primarily assigned to different stages by choosing different stage cycle times so as to have the stage idleness within the specified limit. Later, the line is further balanced and the stage idleness is smoothed by trading and transferring the tasks, or crashing the worst stages. The line is then balanced by adjusting the manpower at different stages. Several proofs and models have been formulated regarding the generalization of paralleling to serial line balance, some design aspects of manpower utilization, the superiority rule of strategic policy for choosing stage cycle times, etc. The balance is chosen through cost optimization. © 1983 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The response of several existing group technology cells in a periodic simultaneous multi-batch input environment was obtained with intra-cell batch split and transfer. A comprehensive deterministic computer simulation program was used to model the cells. Within the logic of the program a post-operation transfer quantity termed a 'sub-batch1 was specified for each operation of individual components. Relevant performance criteria including a setting time penalty were defined and experiments were performed with various values of the transfer quantity. It was found that the performance of group technology cells can be improved through sub-batch work transfer, while the extent of such improvements are extremely case dependent even for cells operating side by side and subject to the same general controlling and constraining influences. In this context the role of simulation as a tool for system analysis was also demonstrated. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"To design new—or to redesign old—manufacturing facilities in the future will require a much broader systems view than has been used in the past. The total ecosystem, in which the manufacturing sub-system is merely one component, must be considered and optimized. This has not been done in the past, to the detriment of the ecosystem. The problem is therefore one where the internal activities of the manufacturing system must be correlated with the externalities in the larger ecosystem in order to achieve the necessary optimization. The real problem is how to do this, and how should the internalities and externalities be measured? Examples are given to indicate the magnitude of the problem. The two most directly related factors causing it are suggested to be overpopulation and inadequate and inappropriate decision criteria in the form of product cost minimization. The former creates facilities design conditions and increasing rates of use of basic resources. The latter creates inadequate systems designs, as history has so recently demonstrated. The problem therefore is to establish better criteria, more efficient measures of effectiveness, and hopefully to develop studies that will replace empiricism and intuition with known measurements that will allow optimization of the total ecosystem leading to an improved ‘ quality of life ’ for all. © 1971, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A stochastic theory of grinding is advanced from which some important statistical properties of the resulting ground surface are derived in terms of the basic parameters and dimensions of the grinding wheel used. If a Gaussian abrasive height distribution is assumed it is shown that the workplace height distribution will be negatively skewed. Use of a more rigorous height distribution based on the physical structure of the abrasive predicts that the workpiece height distribution will initially be skewed but will tend to Gaussian with further grinding. The model explains the reduction in roughness of the ground surface when the wheel is sparked out and permits its numerical prediction.

"Production processes are most frequently classified in the literature into one of three categories: projects, intermittent processes (i.e. job or flow shops). or continuous processes (i.e. assembly lines or flow processes).

"AUTOMAT consists of a range of computer techniques which can assist the Work Study Engineer in the design and evaluation of manual work tasks. AUTOMAT provides a means for introducing MTM at any level of detail with a reduction in the time and cost taken to produce analyses. Since the computer allows the work study engineer to describe an operation using a high-level language while producing output at the detailed MTM-2 level, the time spent on clerical work and calculations is significantly less. The program itself provides a means of studying methods with a view to improvement, and a by-product of using the computer is a high level of consistency. To complement AUTOMAT's coverage of manual work, COMPUTE has been designed to enable the work study engineer to store formulae for different machining operations or processes and to recall these formulae to substitute parameters describing particular situations. Using simple coding and filing techniques the engineer can associate the formulae with synthetic time elements for manual work to produce complete work standards for process-type operations. The introduction of COMPUTE enables work study records in this environment to be structured sensibly and ensures a greater degree of accuracy. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Recent research on the scheduling of job shops has demonstrated the need for dispatching rules that are effective over a wide range of due-date tightness. In this paper a new dispatching rule is presented and compared with other prominent dispatching rules. The new rule employs shortest-processing-time (SPT) scheduling in a controlled manner: using due-date information to expedite jobs that are late or behind schedule, and employing a heuristic to control the scheduling of jobs with long processing times. Based on a simulation analysis, the rule is shown to perform nearly as well as the SPT rule with respect to mean job flowtime, and without the undesirable SPT side-effect of large conditional mean tardiness. The rule is also shown to be robust to changes in due-date tightness. In comparison with other well-known dispatching rules, its performance is generally superior with respect to mean flowtime, mean tardiness and conditional mean tardiness, with only the COVERT rule performing nearly as well. Unlike the COVERT rule, which requires the estimation of a job's remaining shop queue time, the proposed rule requires no estimation of global shop characteristics. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In this paper we examine the direct use of cost/profit information in random and flow shops where early shipments are forbidden. The ‘forbidden early shipment’ environment is typical of many JIT situations, since vendors must deliver parts on their due dates, not before. Hence an order finishing early must be held in a finished-goods inventory until its shipment date. Therefore managerial policies are needed which finish jobs right on time, neither early nor late. This paper looks at value-based and time-based priority scheduling rules and examines the performance of these rules in money terms, as well as by earliness and tardiness measures. Overall, the results show that forbidding early shipments has a major impact on the performance of the value rules proposed in our earlier research. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A new information system approach to the operational controls of automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS) is developed and examined. This approach is based on artificial intelligence, state-operator framework for problem solving. Gradually increasing the information level, several operational goal functions are identified for an industrial unit-load food produce AS/RS. These functions use real-time statistical interpolations to select the desired storage and retrieval bins. As a result the AS/RS response adapts itself to stochastic perturbations in the system conditions. Experimental evaluations using multiple variance analysis technique and detailed simulations have shown that the proposed dynamic approach is superior to the common industrial control method currently used in those industrial systems characterized by batch arrivals (and retrievals) of the UL's and non-stationary demand patterns, These evaluations further suggest that improved performance is realized with the increase in the information level. The operational control scheme developed in this paper appears to be an excellent control alternative for unit-load AS/RSs.

"This paper explains an approach to establishing the total reliability of cutting tools on feeding automatic machine lines as a function of time, and based on this the establishment of cutting-tool costs and total machining costs as a function of cutting-tool reliability. Based on observations, made over a long period, cutting-tool reliability is established for certain operations (Weibull distribution), and the total reliability for the whole line established as the product of the individual operations. Cutting-tool costs are shown as the sum of tool replacement, sharpening and depreciation costs, and total machining costs as the sum of machining values, machine tools and cutting tools. By variation of the cutting-tool replacement time, the tabular change dependencies are obtained as a function of cutting-tool replacement time. By elimination of replacement time from the above dependencies, the cutting-tool cost changes and machining costs are obtained as a function of the cutting-tool reliability.

"Two types of quantity discounts are treated in the literature, namely, 'all units' discounts and incremental quantity discounts. In the all units quantity discounts model, the discount applies to every unit purchased. As a result, the total purchase cost is a discontinuous function of the quantity ordered. In other words, the cost of purchasing a quantity below a quantity for which a discount applies may be higher than that of purchasing the larger discount-applicable quantity. An obvious remedy to the discontinuous total purchase cost is to be able to buy a large enough quantity to qualify for a certain discount and then dispose of the excess at some finite disposal cost. Moreover, the assumption of a finite unit disposal cost is more realistic than that of the infinite disposal cost, which rules out any disposal. This paper introduces a finite unit disposal cost in the lot size model with all units quantity discounts and develops a method of obtaining optimal lot sizes for an entire range of unit disposal costs. © 1984 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Cellular manufacturing is gaining increasing popularity as a way to quickly improve productivity and competitiveness. As a result, much research has been devoted to the development of cell formation techniques. Unfortunately, very little research has been aimed at comparing the numerous cell formation techniques available. Thus, the focus of this research is to compare selected cell formation procedures. To carry out this research, data was collected from three actual manufacturing plants. Next, the selected cell formation procedures were applied to the plants. Finally, simulation models were developed based on the cell formation procedures and evaluated on a number of performance measures. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

External arrivals of jobs are received in a dispatch area from which their release to the job shop is controlled. To overcome the limitation of operational control, we propose three different dispatch policies and compare their performances to that of a first come first served dispatch policy.

"In this article, a framework is proposed for computerization of tool-replacement decision making in flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs). Specifically, a procedure is outlined that addresses the decision of whether a tool should or should not be replaced prior to its processing of a workpart. The proposed procedure attempts to minimize the tool-related economic losses associated with these decisions while maximizing part throughput. The limitations of both the human and the computer at achieving both of these system performance objectives are discussed and form the basis to the proposed procedure. Based on a simulation study examining human capabilities at making tool-replacement decisions, various heuristics employed by humans who were successful at performing this task were identified. These heuristics as well as other considerations were incorporated into the procedure in an effort to maintain a balance between the more direct local consequences and less direct global consequences of tool-replacement decisions on the economic and throughput objectives, respectively. The article concludes with a discussion on the role of sensitivity analysis, and the use of the procedure within the context of human supervisory control of FMSs. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper presents an analytical method for configuring the network of a fixed-path, closed-loop material handling system. The method is applicable to towlines, automated monorail systems (AMS), automated guided vehicles systems (AGVS), and other equipment types. The purpose is to make good initial decisions with respect to adding shortcuts (cutbacks), adding off-line spurs, and their length, so that of the thousands or millions of possible network configurations only a very small number need subsequently to be examined by simulation. The approach taken is to develop volume-delay curves for load-carriers passing a load/unload station, based on average transport requirements. Using this information we develop, as a function of the number of carriers moving past a station, cost curves that include carrier costs and spur costs, for the two possible situations at each station: build or don't build a spur. A mainline blocking tolerance is used to determine the spur capacity for the build situation. After linearization, the segments of the cost curves are represented by a set of mathematical network flow arcs, with some arcs representing fixed costs and others representing variable costs. We minimize the sum of load-carrier costs and spur costs in this flow network by using a general purpose integer programming algorithm. The problem solution indicates where off-line spurs and shortcuts should be constructed, the number of carriers required, their recommended routeings, and the average flow on each part of the system. The trade-off between the costs of alternative networks, influenced by shortcuts, spurs, load-carrier costs, and by routeing and congestion, is demonstrated by a small example with seven stations. The capability of the method is shown by solution of a different example, one involving 32 build-don't build decisions. Future work in this area is planned with two objectives in mind: simplifying and speeding up the analytical method presented in this report; and linking the analytical method with a simulation procedure. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper presents a knowledge-based scheduling approach based on the problem-solving techniques developed in artificial intelligence. The approach is based on three key techniques. The first is the pattern-directed inference technique to capture the dynamic nature of the scheduling environment. The second is the non-linear planning technique to coordinate manufacturing processes and resource assignments. The third technique is the A* search algorithm to expedite the searching procedure. It models the scheduling process by state-space transitions; the job routing is obtained through selecting a sequence of scheduling operators guided by heuristics. Keeping track of the manufacturing system by a symbolic world model, this approach is adaptive to such environmental changes as new job arrivals and machine breakdowns, suitable for making real-time scheduling decisions. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Techniques useful in the planning phase of productive systems and elsewhere are presented. Assuming only that item distributions of times to failure and repair are exponential, the availability of any redundant stage consisting of identical items can be calculated in terms of the item availability, without specific knowledge of failure and repair rates. The availability of a series of stages is greater than the product of the stage availabilities, if unfailed stages are not at risk during system failure. A general expression is developed to account for this. By considering all the possible states of the stages of a system, the overall productiveness or system effectiveness can be estimated.

"An implicit assumption underlying most inventory systems is that the lot ordered will not contain any defective, i.e., unsaleable items when delivered and so there will be no 'shortages' in the delivery in the sense that every unit of the product in the accepted lot is of perfect quality and therefore fully weeptable to the customers. Such an arsumption is not always tenable in view of the extensive use of acceptance sampling by business and industry in the quality control process. The presence of defective items in the traditional inventory models which foresee no such possibility would certainly diarupt the systems in use, and consequently entail higher operating cost on the inventory management. With an aim to broaden the base of applications, and to clemonstrate the impacts of the possible presence of defective products upon the structure and the cost of ertain inventory systems, this paper extends two inventory models to the oa.se where the proportion ofdefective units in the accepted lot is a random variable with known probability distributiols.

"This paper presents a statistical method for selecting the best inspector for visual inspection having the highest defect-finding ability among k(22) prospecti\, e inspectors. A sample containing known number of defects are submitted to each of k prospective inspectors. As the sample size is increased, sampling variation decreases so that we have a better chance of selecting the truly best inspector, but at the same time the cost of sampling is also increased. The problem is how to determine the sample size required for selecting the best inspector with specified probability Ps. This problem is formulated from the indifference zone point of view with an application of the loss function which takes into consideration the opportunity cost of making a wrong selection and the cost of sampling. Minimax solution is obtained under the restriction that the best inspector is to be selected with the specified probability P*.

"This paper deals with a method for scheduling and control of a maching job shop where the average number of operation stages per part is six and the average operation time per stage is about one hour. The method is based on the adjustment of load balance among machines and the limitation of the amount of work input. By simulation with real data, it was found that two variables, the load balance and input amount of work, definitely influence shop performances such as lateness, mean flow time and utilization of machines. If these two variables are well controlled, good results can be obtained no matter what the dispatching priority rules on the shop floor may be. © 1984 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Current manacturing and material handling systems contain a high degree of automation, and more sophisticated automation is predicted for the manufacturing and materia] handling systems of the future. As the systems have become larger and more complex, so have the tasks facing design engineers in synthesizing the various manual and equipment subsystems into a total system with predictable capabilities. In very large complex systems it is difficult to envision the interaction of subsystems, much less predict the effect of a variable change in subsystem on the total system. This paper outlines the factors which have prevented the more widespread use of simulation modelling by design engineers and operating managers and presents an approach towards overcoming these factors. The research presented focuses on the construction of a generalized simulator system that allows the ultimate users of the simulation results, the design engineers and operating managers, to construct and exercise their own simulation models of large complex systems. The use of the generalized model is explained and its application in simulating a large complex system is illustrated by an example, In addition, the effectiveness of a current technique for the design of an open system was investigated and the paper presents an improved design technique that resulted from the research. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this paper we consider a piece of manufacturing equipment dedicated to the production of a family of items. With known level demand rates for the individual items the policy used is to cycle through production of all of the items every T units of time. As usual, T is a decision variable, but we also permit the individual item production rates to be treated as controllable variables (within prescribed limits). We develop procedures for establishing the appropriate production rates and these are illustrated with numerical examples. It is shown that, under certain circumstances, significant potential costs savings can be realized by slowing down the production rate of just one key item in the family. Slowing down production reduces inventory levels consistent with a Just-in-Time manufacturing philosophy. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper develops a decision rule to enable an a priori classification of a production system that should utilize a JIT- or WIP-type inventory control policy. A two-station deterministic serial production system is analysed. A parameter a— the ratio between WIP and maximum shortage—is defined, and a cost function K — f(α) is modelled. It is shown that α*—an optimum value of α—is a characteristic parameter of the system, can be evaluated a priori based on known parameters, and can serve to identify a production system as JIT type or WIP type. The concept of an OC curve of a system is introduced and it is concluded that JIT is not always favourable over WIP. An extension of the deterministic case shows that α* can be expressed, among others, in terms of MTBF and MTTR.

"This paper examines the causes of nonsteady-state behaviour in manual assembly lines and shows that several of them will result in transient behaviour which is equivalent to line ‘start-up’ conditions where interstage buffer stores are either all empty or all full of part finished items. These two conditions of and lsquo;empty start’ and and lsquo;full start’ are simulated in order to determine the magnitude of the initial deviation of operating behaviour from steady-state and the length of time required for the line to resume steady-state behaviour. Expressions are developed which relate transient magnitude and length to the number of stations in the line and the interstation buffer capacity. Lines whose mean station work times have been imbalanced are also simulated under similar nonsteady-state conditions. It is concluded that in certain conditions the performance of some lines subject to repeated disturbance can be improved by deliberate station work time unbalancing. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper presents three quasi on-line scheduling procedures for FMSs consisting of work stations, transport devices, and operators. In the scheduling, different types of decisions are taken to perform a particular operation, i.e. the selection of (a) a work station, (b) a transport device and (c) an operator. Further, (d) the scheduling sequence of the operations has to be determined. The three developed procedures differ in the way these four decision problems are solved hierarchically. Several dispatching rules (SPT, SPT.TOT, SPT/TOT and EFTA) are available to solve the last mentioned decision problem. Limited buffer capacities in an FMS may cause deadlock in the procedures as well as in practice. The scheduling procedures involve a buffer handling method to avoid deadlock. A case study is presented to demonstrate the three procedures and to show some of its properties. Based on simulation tests, some conclusions are drawn about the performance of the scheduling procedures and the various dispatching rules. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Temperature gradients in high speed steel tools used to turn iron, titanium and nickel have been measured using a method based on the structural changes in high speed steel heated to temperatures over 560°C. The relationship between temperature gradient, cutting speed and feed rate have been demonstrated through the heat affected region close to the cutting edge. The most emphatic feature of the results is that each of the three metals imposed its own and greatly different pattern of temperature distribution within the tool. It was shown that this controls some of the basic wear processes which limit the rates of metal removal. When cutting iron there was a relatively cool zone close to the cutting edge in the most highly stressed region, while the hottest part was well back from the edge; the temperature gradients were very Bteep. When cutting titanium the higher temperatures were much closer to the cutting edge, and the total heated region was smaller, while the temperature gradients were again very steep. When cutting nickel the tool edge was at least as hot as elsewhere in the heat affected area, and temperature gradients.near the edge were much less steep. The results have Televance to the understanding of tool wear, the design of cutting tools and the application of cutting lubricants. © 1975, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1975,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, there is a case for defining and examining more closely the influence of order-handling systems upon productivity. Using case study examples, the paper describes a new approach to the analysis of order-processing systems. Possibilities for shortening delivery lead times are identified by examining company administrative procedures. producing diagrams of information and work flows within the organization. These may then be converted into lists of positive and negative influences upon throughput time. Alternative strategies for productivity improvement are evaluated according to their effect·upon time consumption, through (a) the collapse of durations of those activities essential to order completion (termed 'positive' factors); and (b) the elimination of delays and excess slack (, negative' factors) to reduce idle time for individual orders. The conclusions presented concern the relevance of the study of order handling systems to the identification of potential improvements in management productivity; the nature of the efficiency gains that may be made and the most appropriate methods of realizing the potential gains that exist in any individual system. © 1985 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper demonstrates problems in allocating inter-station inventory capacities in unpaced production lines with heteroscedastic processing times. Simulations were performed to show the effects of total work-in-process inventory capacity, relative inter-station inventory allocations and pattern of processing time variances upon production rate, work station idle times and time to complete a product. Tradeoffs among the three performance measures were observed and deficiencies in intuitive strategies for redesigning lines were deduced.",1977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Scheduling in process industries is exceedingly challenging, due to the high capital intensity, relatively long and sequence-dependent setup times, and extremely limited capacity resources that are found in these industries. As a result, it is important to simultaneously consider lot sizing and sequencing factors in the development of a production schedule. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming model for scheduling production in process industries that embodies the economic trade-offs encompassed in three avenues of research: capacitated lot sizing, flowshop scheduling and sequencing with sequence-dependent setup times. The model is used to schedule production Tor a problem representative of those found in the food processing industry. The corresponding schedule is then compared with approaches that consider lot sizing and sequencing as independent decisions and it is shown that decomposing the scheduling problem into smaller subproblems can result in the generation of infeasible production schedules. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Numerous articles suggest using the Japanese manufacturing strategy of minimizing inventories by producing small lot sizes. However, few studies actually have investigated the relative advantages or disadvantages of such a strategy. Worker productivity improvements during production of a batch (learning)and the loss of productivity improvements due to the breaks between batches (forgetting)both influence the optimal lot size for a product. The results of this study indicate that worker forgetting in a batch production environment can substantially increase optimal lot sizes. Since forgetting causes a type of setup cost by penalizing breaks in production, it is intuitive to expect an increase in optimal lot size for forgetting. This study confirms the expectation. What is interesting, however, is that only a small amount of forgetting is required to substantially increase the optimal lot size. The conditions under which lot sizes need to be significantly increased are discussed and illustrated. The results also suggest that special attention must be given to eliminate forgetting due to production disruption when using just-in-time scheduling techniques to reduce lot sizes. The use of automated processes in batch production may overcome the need for large lot sizes by negating the worker forgetting cost, which is a form of setup cost. Robotic technologies or flexible manufacturing systems are types of automated processes which can diminish the forgetting effect in a batch production mode, and therefore, allow efficient production of small lot sizes. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper investigates the effect of different buffering strategies on the performance of production line systems. Three models of different buffering strategies are studied. Each buffering strategy represents a different degree or flexibility of the storage buffers in the system. We first prove the analytical result that system throughput increases with the degree of flexibility for the three models in this study. Simulation results are then presented to compare the performance of the three models under different system configurations.

"Previous work on optimal allocation of work to production line systems has found that the throughput of a production line is maximized by deliberately unbalancing the line in an appropriate way when the processing time distribution is exponential or Erlang. A recent simulation study suggests that unbalancing the production line may not improve the efficiency of the line when the processing times are normally distributed. However, it appears that the unbalanced work allocation being studied may not be chosen appropriately in the simulation study and therefore, no significant improvement (and actually a decrease) in performance was observed when compared with the perfectly balanced work allocation. This study performs a similar set of simulation experiments of the previous study with normally distributed processing times, but uses more appropriate unbalanced work allocations to determine whether the efficiency of a production line can be improved if the line is unbalanced appropriately. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This report proposes a method of estimating the amount of safety stock needed in each station of a production line due to variation in processing times, machine breakdowns and demand fluctuation in order to meet a predetermined desired level of performance. The production line is assumed to operate as a pull system and the measure of performance is the average percentage of demand backlogged. Multiple machines and different batch sizes in the stations are included in the model. Dynamic production control is used and is based on the current inventory level in every station of the system. Simulation results are used to test the performance of the system in which the maximum inventory level allowed in each station is based on the estimation given by our method. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Programming costs occupy a significant ratio to machining costs when any prototype with complicated forms is tentatively machined. The ratio of the programming cost to the total processing cost will become a more considerable amount as its shape is more complicated, or as its lot size is smaller. For this reason, some adequate and reasonable estimate of the cost may be demanded. Before finding the way to estimate the software cost, we investigated in some enterprises several items in which costs are involved, the planning time and the numbers of steps of the program in connection with some actual examples oh which these data are based for (1) manual programming, (2) APT without MACRO and (3) APT with MACRO. The final aim of our study is to find a way of estimating software costs or of performance evaluation.

"An algorithm is developed for the analysis of the traffic behaviour in the recirculating conveyor with stochastic inputs and outputs. The approach is through the theory of conveyor systems as ordered entry queueing systems, extended to include models with recirculation. The analysis of overflow traffic from loss models and the superposition of two general point processes combine to yield an approximation for the first two moments of the processes on both the outward and inward cycles of the conveyor. A simulation model of the conveyor is also developed. A comparison of the simulation with the algorithm not only indicates the accuracy of the algorithm, but points out the inherent shortcomings of the simulation approach.

"In this paper an EOQ model is developed especially for a production environment where the inventory to be controlled is raw material. The fundamental difference between this model and others is that a stochastic demand is placed upon the inventory in terms of the time for an individual to consume one unit of inventory rather than the number of units consumed in some time interval. A shortage cost for inventory is imposed via the idle machine (man) cost. The optimal re-order quantity is determined as a function of the stockout probability and the optimal stockout probability is obtained via a one-dimensional search, over some prescribed set of feasible stockout probabilities. © 1975, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1975,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This article describes a heuristic algorithm which will yield an optimal or near optimal minimal makespan solution to a specific type of sequencing/scheduling problem defined as the dependent sequencing problem which includes the pure job-shop and flow-shop sequencing problems. The name ‘ dependent sequencing ’ was selected for this model since it reflects the possibility of interdependence between activities of the technological processing order graph (GTPO) not present in ‘ pure ’ job -shop or f low-shop sequencing models. There are some approaches to this class of problem which provide optimal solutions, but their time to solutions and/or theoretical approaches make them difficult to understand and apply. Recent articles in the literature have recommended that research in the sequencing/scheduling area be directed toward developing practical approaches which can be easily understood and applied. The dependent shop algorithm utilizes extensions of PERT/CPM techniques which are widely known and therefore, can be easily applied. © 1973 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Two experiments were carried out to examine the effects on the comprehension by a drawing reader of linear dimension tolerance information when it was presented in different ways. The presentation methods studied arc those outlined1 in B.S. 30S: 1953. In the first experiment 12 students and 12 school children with no previous knowledge of engineering drawings had to chock whether a given value, representing an actual dimension, was inside or outside tolerance as indicated on a drawing. Significant differences in time taken and errors made were associated with different methods of presenting tolerance information. Explicit indication of upper and lower dimension values was superior. The error behaviour of subjects suggested that spatial stereotypes were operating in their interpretation of two of the three tolerance presentation methods and that, because of this, they were making mistakes. In the second experiment 20 experienced engineering workshop machine operators had to state what final machining aiming point they would use if they were working to a presented drawing of part of an engineering component. Various sizes of tolerance values and ways of presenting them were used on different drawings. The results showed that the chosen aiming point was dependant on size of tolerance but not on method of presentation of tolerance. Also the nominal or ‘design’ dimension was most valuable to the machine operator in preference to explicit indications of the upper and lower dimension limits. The paper concludes with a suggestion for and discussion of a compromise method of tolerance presentation which might be more error free and more generally acceptable for all types of reader. © 1972 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The problem of an n-job, M-stage flowshop with sequence dependent set-up times is discussed. A mixed integer linear program (MILP) is formulated with considerably reduced number of integer binary variables, than if the same problem were formulated with integer variables defined as Xij = 1 if job i is sequenced immediately before job j, and 0 otherwise. The inclusion of set-UQ times, sequence dependency and M stages makes this formulation different from most other flowshop formulations in the literature, since such problems have not been given due consideration. This paper contributes a unique formulation to handle flowshop problems in the process industry where the set-up times have a definite dependence on the sequence in which jobs are processed. Computational results have been compared for problems up to six jobs and stages where the objective has been to minimize the makespan.

"A practical problem of significant importance for many manufacturing systems is machine interference. Interference is undesirable and unnecessary machine idleness that is caused by allowing one (or more) operator(s) to tend several machines. When the service demands of machines are not synchronized, both operators and machines can experience interference. Interference obviously decreases the productivity of a manufacturing system. Most interference models are designed to attempt to minimize the cost of interference, or simply the interference itself. In this paper, we survey the literature and classify various interference problems, models and associated assumptions, and solution techniques. Theoretical results are given. Industrial applications of the models that have been reported in the literature are also described. Finally, future applications of such interference models to robotics and flexible manufacturing systems are outlined. © 1985 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The system is a real one, consisting of nine machines, an insjxxtion station, and a centralized queueing area—all interconnected by an automatic material-handling mechanism.

"In this paper, the applications of computer simulation and statistically designed experiments are presented as a means to diagnostically evaluate and design more efficient, layouts for manufacturing job-shops. The simulation model is defined and driven based entirely on actual operating data, shop procedures and the physical configuration of the shop. Utilizing the flexibility and realism of a simulation model, layout analysis is conducted to evaluate the effects of changes in material handling methods, in-process storage locations and various operating procedures on shop floor congestion and job throughput. An experimental design is used to allow statistical comparison of the results in the light of the variability of the entire shop system and a predictive model for mean job flow time is developed using multiple regression analysis. The results show than an improved layout and better operating procedures can eliminate the need for additional capital investment and work force expenses, yet still provide improvements in the overall productivity of the shop. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In this paper a heuristic procedure is developed for solving the problem of planning machine replacements for a serially dependent production system. Given a finite planning horizon, the decision-maker wishes to decide (1) which periods, if any, that the entire production system must be shut down in order to make replacements, and (2) what specific machine or machines in the system should be scheduled for replacement during each of these downtime periods. The problem involves a balancing of costs. If the production system is brought down to make one or more replacements a fixed downtime cost is incurred; this cost is independent of the machines replaced during the downtime. In addition, other fixed coats are incurred for each of the machines replaced. Our motivation for scheduling these replacements is to realize lower variable costs for operating the machines. The variable operating costs are assumed to increase as the age or vintage of the machines increases. An optimal replacement policy is one in which the total of the present-value fixed and operating costs are minimized for the entire planning horizon. The paper also presents computational results using the heuristic to solve a large number of randomly generated test problems of varying numbers of machines and periods. These heuristic solutions are compared to known optimal solutions for a number of the problems. One of the important advantages of the heuristic procedure is that it is capable of producing several solutions to a given problem, all rank ordered by increasing cost. Thus, the decision-maker is afforded alternative choices from which he or she may select a replacement policy. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper describes a heuristic procedure for sequencing the n job m machine static flowshop. Basically, the procedure is performed in two overall steps. In the first step, each of the n jobs is tested as a potential immediate follower to each of the other jobs. In effect, this step of the procedure asks the question, ‘how well does a particular job fit in terms of job blocking or machine idleness if it were to follow some other job?’ An overall figure of merit, or cost cij, is determined for each job j as a follower to another job i. Six different heuristics are presented for determining sets of cij values. Using these values of cij, the second step then heuristically develops a job sequence by solving the travelling salesman problem. The paper also presents computational experience with the algorithm for a variety of randomly generated test problems (up to 50 jobs and 50 machines in size), and compares its performance with other published heuristic techniques. © 1982 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Several benefits have been claimed from the introduction of cellular manufacture. One of these benefits is simplified Production Control. A general consensus of opinion, by exponents and users alike, is that a detailed, well defined production control system must be designed if benefits are to accrue from cellular manufacture. The performance of a manufacturing system is dependent upon many criteria and it has its own rules, conditions and limitations. Production control system in cellular manufacture is no exception. This paper attempts to define some important Production Control problems and identifies various factors and features which influence effective control of cell production. The design of a production control system within cellular manufacture is quite complex. It requires a good definition of component families to set up a balanced manufacturing cell in terms of numbers of machines and men to give optimum utilization and efficiency. The layout of the cell should be such that the flow of material can be maintained through the machines to optimize work-in-progress levels and minimize queueing problems. Sequence Technology, coupled with reduced batch size and Period Batch control, appears to achieve the desired level of throughput and maintain optimum work-in-progress in a cell. However, optimum schedules will vary according to the weight given to different criteria and savings. Several simulation studies have been carried out to understand the relative effects of such criteria and simple analysis can be used to make decisions in finding a viable and near optimum solution. © 1984 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A computer study of the performance of the proposed dispatching rule is conducted based on a four-machine cell, and the results are reported and analysed. The conclusions obtained are that the proposed dispatching rule produces cell's makespans, better than the CEXSPT dispatching rule, because it reduces idle time on cell's machines. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In a previous paper (Grünwald et al. 1989) a framework for the comparison of production and inventory control concepts has been developed. In this paper, the framework will be elaborated for the experimental comparison of control concepts by means of computer simulations. Attention will be focused on three control concepts: Reorder point (ROP), base stock control (BSC), and manufacturing resource planning with safety stocks (MRP). The performance of these control concepts is compared as a function of the production situation (products, processes, and market)The percentage of customer orders delivered in time and the total average stock are chosen as performance indicators. An important aspect of the comparison is the optimization of control parameters (e.g. stock norms) for each specific combination of control concept and production situation. For each investigated production situation, the difference between control concepts is quantified. The simulation results show remarkable differences in performance between control concepts. These differences strongly depend on the production situation and on the selected values for the control parameters.

"A now method of producing thin-walled seamless metal belts is discussed. The method incorporates the principles of float-rolling (CBS rolling), whereby metal strip is pinched between a small diameter floating roll and two large diameter back-up rolls which rotate with different peripheral speeds. Whereas in conventional rolling reduction may be controlled by regulating the roll gap opening, in float-rolling reduction is insensitive to changes in roll gap opening and is controlled instead by varying the speed differential between the two back-up rolls. In this report, the relationships between reduction and roll speeds, roll gap opening, and strip tension are described, and some observations of rolling loads and torques are reported. Several problems associated with the production of belts by the float-rolling method are also discussed. © 1973 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"High volume, highly automated, information intensive, short cycle manufacturing systems severely tax most conventional statistical process control techniques. To meet this new manufacturing domain's control requirements, a new approach is needed. This paper presents such a process control procedure, sufficient statistics process control (SSPC). By drawing on empirical Bayes techniques, SSPC models the time sequence of the process while simultaneously reducing to a few sufficient statistics the large volume of incoming data. As a result, it provides real time, on-line quality control. The paper discusses the conceptual and mathematical foundations for SSPC. Its operation is illustrated through an example. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of the limitations of SSPC. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The Toyota Production System and Kanban System introduced in this paper was developed by the Vice-President of Toyota Motor Company, Mr. Taiiohi Ohno, and it was under his guidance that these unique production systems have become deeply rooted in Toyota Motor Company in the past 20 years. There are two major distinctive features in these systems. One of these is the ‘just-in-time production ’, a specially important factor in an assembly industry such as automotive manufacturing. In this type of production, “ only the necessary products, at the necessary time, in necessary quantity ” are manufactured, and in addition, the stock on hand is held down to a minimum. Second, the System is the ‘respect-for-human’ system where the workers are allowed to display in full their capabilities through active participation in running and improving their own workshops. © 1977, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper presents a mathematical model to determine transitional as well as steady state probabilities of various system states in a conveyor-paced assembly line system with the line-conveyor subject to failure and repair. The analysis helps to predict the effect of system parameters on labour efficiency, output rate, and system down time. The on-line service time distribution has been taken as general for wider applicability. An optimization problem for a business concern is then formulated taking into account all the relevant economic implications, and solved for a numercial example by STJMT. The profit function is seen to be a concave function with the cost structure as presented here. The results of the numerical example give convincing evidence that, when the problem is seen in totality, neither worker utilization nor output remain the criteria for optimization. © 1983 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The problem of scheduling parallel processors in a make-to-stock environment with sequence setup costs is considered. A new algorithm which formulates a series of 0-1 integer sub problems is proposed and contrasted with an earlier formulation (Dearing and Henderson 1982,1984). Parallels between the sub problem formulations and generalized networks are discussed. The efficiency and quality of the solutions provided were tested using previously published data for a loom assignment problem. The heuristic solution was evaluated against the optimal integer linear programming (ILP) solution, and a rounded linear program (LP) approximation to the optimal solution for several sample problems.

"This paper outlines the use of the goal programming technique in selecting levels of machining parameters in a fine turning operation on A1S1 4140 steel using cemented tungsten carbide tools. Goals that are proposed to be achieved are: (i) to finish turning the required depth in one pass, mid (ii) to finish turning within a stipulated time. Constraints used are: R.M.S. surface finish values, cutting horse power of the machine, ranges for cutting speed, feed and depth of cut. A predictive equation to predict the R.M.S. Surface roughness values from the machining variables, cutting speed, feed, depth of cut, and time of cut was used.

"Block diagonalization of binary matrices is a primary step in the design of cellular production systems. ‘Grouping efficiency’ which is a weighted average of two measures that consider the voids in the diagonal blocks and exceptional elements in the off-diagonal blocks was the only criterion available to measure the goodness of block diagonal forms. The present work critically analyses this function and brings out its shortcomings, the most severe of them being its low discriminating power. A simple and elegant function has been derived in its place. The new function called grouping efficacy obviates all the defects of the earlier function while retaining the requisite properties. The mathematical properties of the function have been analysed and the function values compared with those of grouping efficiency in the case of well-structured and ill-structured data sets. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A particular form of assembly line is examined by computer assisted simulation for conditions of perfect and imperfect balance between manual work stations. Some account has been taken of a possible response by operators to the pacing inherent in this form of working. Conclusions are drawn in regard to the effects of initial feed rate, variable operator work cycle times and tolerance time (i.e. the time that a part is available for servicing before passing unprocessed) on output, unprocessed work and operator utilization. © 1971 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A model of a particular type of conveyor-based single stage working has been developed and programmed for a digital computer. The model has been used to simulate “mechanical effect” (i.e. the effect of specific settings of feed rate and tolerance time) on an operator's natural unpaced performance. It is shown that operator response to pacing can be dimensioned more properly by reference to “mechanical effect” measures. Also, with assumptions of operator response to pacing the model can be used to predict output, misses and delay for selected conveyor settings. Response, shown as increased rates of working in a real study, has been incorporated in the simulation of paced from unpaced performance. This response has been represented grossly by a reduction in service time if the part, when picked up, has reached a particular proportion of the tolerance zone. Selected speed up effects have given reasonable agreement between simulated and actual successes and misses in a range of feed rates up to 13 per cent above unpaced performance. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1965,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Three operators were studied in the performance of a short assembly task. A comparison has been made between their paced and unpaced performances. With the supply of parts by conveyor, both feed rate and tolerance time were found to have a marked effect on output, delay and the number of parts passing unprocessed. Pacing induced changes in service time distributions. At and below feed rates equivalent to unpaced performances the rhythm of unpaced working was seriously affected. An operator speed up effect resulted in higher output in paced working, compared to unpaced working, at feed rates above unpaced performance. Missed parts increased exponentially with increased feed rate. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1964,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"A few years ago D. Dornfeld, R. Gil and I addressed the problem of numerically controlled punch press sequencing, but did not formally treat the obstacle of how to impose precedence constraints on the sequences (Svestka et al. 1981). This has been accomplished by partitioning the problem into smaller problems and patching them together to satisfy the constraints, or by direct construction of such sequences, usually involving the closest unvisited city (CUC) heuristic. However, these approaches do have some difficulties. For example, the CUC heuristic can fail to generate a feasible solution for such problems even though solutions can be shown to exist. Here, we introduce a new method for imposing precedence constraints, which either finds a feasible solution or shows that there are none. The method can also be more efficient that CUC, for problems with more than 30 hits. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Optimization is rightly claimed to be the most significant factor distinguishing the modern approach to machining processes from the orthodox one. Practical results can be obtained from the application of mathematical modelling and optimization techniques. The paper presents a procedure for solution of machining process optimization problems, with the use of theory of graphs and Bellman’s optimum principle. The finite graph G=(N, A) (where -N denoted a set of nodes and A the set of arcs) here presents the set of feasible solutions. Each are represents a corresponding machining operation and each path the feasible machining process. A number can be associated with each are: the increment of criterion for optimality. Using the optimum principle we can find the shortest possible path in the graph, thus solving given problems of choice for the optimal machining process. There is a variety of ways in which the performance criterion can be formulated. In this paper only those performance measures having sufficient economical justification are considered. We may minimize the costs of machining processes, or optimize economical effectiveness of capital engaged. The method presented can be applied with every additive criterion, as well as with some non-additive ones.

"The interruption of production on machines which are set up for a specific product incurs idle time costs but reduces inventory holding costs. This phenomenon is generally ignored in multi-stage inventory models. Interrupted production runs are economical when the additional costs generated by restarting the machines and by idle time are off-set by the reduced frequency of major set-up costs and by decreased inventory holding costs. Under these circumstances, the machine idle-time can be optimized for each stage.

"In the Japanese automobile and electrical industries it is often necessary to consider the production ordering systems as multi-stage production inventory systems. Previous analyses of production ordering systems have left untouched the variations in the production ordering quantities and inventory at each stage, in spite of the fact that the amplification phenomena of these variations are critical in a multi-stage production inventory system. Generally, we are able to classify the multi-stage production ordering systems into two types, i.e. the push-type and the pull-type. This paper discusses the following subjects concerning the push-type and multi-stage production ordering system based on forecasting: (1) the effects of demand fluctuations and forecast errors on the amplification of production order variations and inventory variations in terms of a basic production ordering model, and (2) the same effects in a modified production ordering model which is able to decrease both the variations in the production ordering quantities and in the inventory at each stage. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper describes the development of an intelligent controller for a fleet of free-ranging automated guided vehicles. The vehicle controller will operate in real-time. Once a transportation request is received, the location where the demand is generated and the nature of the demand is sent to the vehicle controller. Based on this information and the current status of the system, the vehicle controller will perform dispatching, routing, and scheduling tasks for the free-ranging vehicles. For the selected vehicle, the vehicle controller finds a route and then it will schedule the vehicle along that route in a non-conflicting manner. The vehicle controller is capable of detecting and preventing collisions before they occur. Once a collision is detected, the vehicle controller will explore different solutions to prevent the collision. The alternative which will result in the least delay time is the solution which will be selected by the vehicle controller. The inputs to the system are the layout topology, the number of vehicles in the system, and the vehicles' characteristics. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper deals with the problem of developing a production ordering system which maintains high reliability and productivity of multi-stage production and inventory systems with capacity-constraint and machine breakdown. In this paper, two ‘push type’ production ordering systems (Matsuura and Soshiroda 1981) are proposed according to information feedback methods. The influence of forecasting error, the difference between forecasted demands, down-time, and the backlog caused by the restriction of production capacity, upon the production and inventory levels is analysed by each production ordering system. The results indicate that, in designing an effective production ordering system, a feedback method must be chosen according to the conditions of the average loading ratio, the down-time, and the autocorrelation coefficient of demand. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Traditional methods of estimating the ‘process average’ defect rate of a manufacturing process Involves selecting a fixed number of items from the process and using the sample defective proportion as its estimate. If the estimate is required to have a precision proportional to the true process average defect rate, the sample size required is dependent on that true process average. When prior knowledge about the process average is uncertain and its value is low, as in most modem production situations, this binomial sampling scheme often fails to meet the predetermined precision specifications or results in an unnecessarily large number of observations. A well-known sequential estimation method called inverse negative binomial sampling is considered as a potentially more efficient alternative to the traditional binomial fixed sample size approach, particularly under such circumstances. Several existing estimators for the method are presented and compared, from which derives a general estimator whose closed form expressions permit simple determination of moments for estimators fitting this general form. A new estimator is then derived from the general estimator and is shown to be more efficient than the existing ones. The precision of the sequential estimation method using the new estimator is shown to be virtually insensitive to a prior knowledge of the true process average, thereby avoiding the need to provide an initial estimate of it, and therefore making it potentially attractive in practical applications. © 1987 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In the quality control system, most of the information for decision making and problem solving can be obtained by inspection activities. Therefore, the inspection work should be organized to maximize meeting the quality objectives. It has already been publicized that data obtained from measurement of inspection performance will supply an effective basis for assessment and design of the inspection station and inspection job. This paper is intended to report on a case study of measurement of inspection performance conducted for the assessment and design of an inspection job in a manufacturing company. Quality control specialists selected three groups of items having representative deficiencies under routine inspection, inspected as inspection job samples. They had individual inspectors inspect each sample to obtain data consisting of the rate of defects detected out of all the defects, and the proportion of erroneous findings in the total number of findings by each inspector. Thus they identified many problems in the inspection job to be corrected to enhance the inspection accuracy. Appropriate action was taken to remedy the situation. In the first place, the inspection job was redesigned. In the second, the method of training inspectors was reviewed and modified. As a result, the probability of defects passing the inspection undetected was greatly reduced. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Competitive pressures continually force management to examine cost and quality levels of production systems. In this paper these issues are addressed via a model that synthesizes several potential features of production systems: production processes, quality control procedures, in-process inventory and reprocessing. For any specified inspection configuration the model can be used, for serial production systems, to obtain closed-form expressions for two important decision variables: optimal lot size and reprocessing batch size, which minimize the total system costs. A numerical example highlights the interdependencies and the role of various system features in determining the values of the decision variables and hence in reducing the total costs.

First, they often tend to be based on approaches that encompass deterministic operating parameters when, in fact, realistic production systems have probabilistic operating parameters. Secondly, they are often applicable only to small noncomplex production lines. It is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate how Q-GERT network modelling and simulation can be employed to ascertain the effect of these realistic operating conditions on a line balancing procedure. Once such effects have been determined it will be shown how simulation can be used to adapt the line balancing procedure to realistic operating conditions. © 1982 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this paper, we examine and quantify the effects of introducing new processing flexibility in the rapidly changing environment of printed circuit board (PCB) assembly. Specifically, we perform experiments designed to establish the benefits and determine the limitations associated with the introduction of routeing flexibility. We examine system behaviour as batch sizes are reduced in an environment characterized by moderate set-up requirements. We further demonstrate that the performance of flexible routeing policies in this environment is adversely affected by larger batch sizes and that the introduction of routeing flexibility leads to improved system performance in small batch assembly. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Analytical approximations for the performance of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) with blocking of machines due to limited local buffers are presented. The approximations are based on a detailed analysis of FMS configurations used in industry. The method proposed uses informations generated by applying the classical closed queueing network (CQN) model to the FMS. The approximations developed are tested against simulation models for a wide variety of FMS configurations. The results presented show that the approximations are very good. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper suggests a new multidimensional classification method (CMDC-II), which is a method for finding the design rules of effective work groups by determining rational combinations of workers, tasks and supervisors. The CMDC-II is a new method for providing design rules from the viewpoint of design goal attainment. The features of our methodology are summarized as follows. Technical, social and organizational factors are introduced as attributes of task, worker and supervisor. Goals, criteria, standards and goal sets are integrated into a multidimensional space. The design rules are found by the use of the CMDC-II. The design is performed by determining an effective combination of task, worker and supervisor. © 1985 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper suggests a new multidimensional classification method for finding design rules for work groups from the viewpoint of optimizing the interaction of technical, social and organizational factors in work groups. It is called the contingent multidimensional classification method (CMDC) For classifying tasks, the CMDC evaluates three kinds of similarities. (1)Similarity in the attributes of tasks. (2)Similarity in the effects of tasks. (3)Similarity in the attributes of worker and supervisors being assigned the tasks. The effects are measured by such effectiveness indexes as job satisfaction or work performance. Several design rules are needed to adapt to various situations, because there is no single best rule for designing effective work groups. The diverse design rules for determining interrelationships among constituent units of the work group—task, worker and supervisor—can be found by examining the properties of ‘similar task types’ resulting from classifying tasks by CMDC. © 1983 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When demand temporarily decreases, traditional aggregate-scheduling techniques call for either lay-offs, inventory build-ups, or increased worker idle time. For products made in batches or lots, an alternate method is to reduce the lot size, which in turn increases the number of set-ups and decreases the total production without affecting the work-force level. The latter effect is of particular significance in businesses that desire to maintain a constant work- force. This paper presents a method for finding the optimal (in terms of cost) lot sizes under the constraint that the work-force size remains constant. Multiple products are allowed, and a finite production rate is assumed. The method is compared to traditional methods in a case study. Compared to undertime, the use of reduced lot sizes is found to produce lower inventory costs and better customer service. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In October 1964 an article was published titled 'Jobshop planning', describing a rathcr simple but, cffective manual system. From that time onwards quite a number of workshops within Philips have adopted production control systems baser! on these principles. The jobshops meant here manufacture spare parts, complete machinery and tine mechanical tools in small series, or single items on L-ustomer orders; 40 to 150 craftsmen were employed in each of them. What we wanted to achieve was short and reliable delivery timcs and a high utilization of production capacity. In ten of these jobshops, operating the system for periods of one to four years, the performa.nces were inventorized. However, the fair results achieved seemed to be in contradiction to theoret.ioal studies made nt. the same time. Therefore in addition to the survey an investigation was made as to why these differences occurred. Since that time many equivalent control systems and methods of reorganizing production capacity have becn developed for the same purpose. Some of them are described more 01' less globally. Also computerized systems have been introduced. One of them, called WASP, was selected as a comparable and cheap alternative for manual 'jobshop planning'. Six of the jobshops which had chosen WASP were questioned on the same subject.

"A combined manual and decision task may be viewed as an arrangement of manual components, one or more of which involves uncertainty due to some input random process. An experiment was run involving a task containing a 4-alteniative choice element for the decision component. The other components involved motions that have been found to be typical of many operational environments. The probabilistic conditions that were varied over the choice element consisted of 6 discrete probability functions for each of independent (random sequences) and Markov dependent structures. The component performance times were found to be gamma distributed, but tended to independent normals as subjects progressed toward fully-learned states. For fully-learned subjects, only the decision component was affected by the uncertainty, and these effects did not vary significantly between the independent and Markov structures. Subjects employed a motion strategy at the decision component that was a function of the most probable stimulus A prediction equation was developed for the mean decision component time as a function of the entropy of the choice element. This was combined with the means of the other component times for predicting the mean total cycle time The experimental mean manual times were compared to a time standard derived by the Methods-Time Measurement system of predetermined times. Applications of the results are discussed in terms of using predetermined motion time for evaluating methods and establishing time standards for combined manual and decision tasks. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Previous studies suggest that performance of a series system may be enhanced if those station(s) having smallest mean operation time requirement(s) and/or smallest variability are placed in the middle of the line. There has been considerable confusion relative to whether this ‘bowl phenomenon’ has to do with the placement of means, variances, or some combination of the two. The results of the current study show that the phenomenon observed is not related to an imbalance in means. Rather, it is associated with an imbalance in absolute variability. Furthermore, it is suggested that the bowl effect vanishes altogether in cases where a minimal level of in-process buffer stock is provided. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Previous studies of the supervisor have tended to stress his work in the “human relations” field, this having been seen as a common element of the supervisor's job. An attempt is made here to analyse the jobs of supervisors at several different levels in a number of plants to demonstrate the range and variety of such work roles and the relation of the overall system of supervision in each case to production problems. New methods of job analysis are being developed for this study. The work roles and behaviour of supervisors in five firms are briefly described. In general, supervisory systems seem to deal with breakdowns and alterations in production planning, but there are, in any given case, a large number of other specific functions served. The research has indicated the importance of technological and organisational variables, besides the “human” variables, in determining supervisory behaviour on the job. © 1961 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

"In an inventory and order based production control system (IOBPCS), there are three fundamental system parameters. One of these, the production delay time, is beyond the control of the IOBPCS designer. Indeed, the production delay may be highly variable with time due to a variety of problems commonly found in manufacturing industry. This uncertainty must be countered by the proper use of a feedback loop which detects and operates on inventory deviations. The IOBPCS designer is thus left with the forward path demand averaging time and feedback path gain to adjust, as best he can. This paper studies the ability of the IOBPCS to recover from shock demands, and to protect the manufacturing process from random variations in consumption. It is shown that the feedback path is of fundamental importance in good control, and that adequate performance cannot be obtained by feedforward alone. Dynamic recovery is examined graphically by separately identifying the feedforward and feedback components. Random disturbance rejection is studied via the noise bandwidth concept. Finally, performance optimization is undertaken using coefficient plane models related to ‘standard forms’ and hardware systems. One good compromise design achieved has the time-to-adjust inventory, demand averaging time, and production delay time all of comparable magnitude. © 1982 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The paper investigates the effect of exponentially smoothing learning curve data plotted in the time constant model form. In the time domain, the result is a smoothed, delayed version, of the raw data. Attenuation of scatter about the trend line is predicted using the z transform method to establish the exponential smoother frequency response. The optimum time shift for trend correction is determined by an analogue method based on the Matsuburu time delay theorem, the result being identical to that obtained using the ‘ equivalent age of data ’ concept. Results for six industrial operators performing light assembly tasks confirm the optimum time delay prediction as judged by the minimization of mean square error criterion, and the frequency response analysis is confirmed on application to a learning curve describing crew performance during a simulated naval underwater mission. © 1977, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A direct method for estimating the parameters of the learning curve time constant model from historical data is presented. Compared with present methods, an assumption on asymptotic performance is unnecessary, and it is much simpler to implement than least error squares curve fitting. An example shows that these advantages are obtained without serious penalties in accuracy The method uses the experimental data to estimate the impulse response of the model. By expanding the model transfer function as an infinite series, the model parameters are obtained by summing the zero and first time moments of the impulse response, thus requiring simple multiplication and no iteration. © 1973 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Command and noise signals expected to operate on specific control systems are often only scantily known at the design stage. This paper considers some of the problems which may arise in choosing a system transfer function when supplied with such inadequate information. A first order linear filter has been considered, and for synthesis purposes both command and noise signals have been represented by flat power spectra. The total power content and bandwidth of both signals have been varied, and the optimum transfer function for the various combinations determined by using the mean square error criterion. With the above assumptions, it is shown that under the circumstances most likely to be met in practice, and in the absence of more specific information, a time constant of one-quarter of the inverse of the expected command signal bandwidth will yield reasonable mean square error performance. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1964,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Human operator output in the performance of repetitive tasks increases with practice, resulting in the ‘ learning curve ’ graph well known in industrial engineering circles. This paper describes the construction of a systems model of the learning curve, the model parameters such as the learning time constant being readily estimated graphically from historical data or in advance of the event using a digital computer algorithm. Learning curve models for individual operators, and for groups of operators, are then used as basic elements in a managerial control system, the inputs to this system being operator effort, industrial engineering effort, and material and financial resources, whilst the output will be completed tasks. The managerial control system is designed to increase productivity by considering four separate feedback loops incorporating the monitoring of individual performance, monitoring of training schemes, updating of time standards, and identification of worker spare capacity leading to group incentive and bettor performance. Each loop is illustrated by an example taken from industry, with associated cost benefits estimated directly from the learning curve models. © 1973 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Western European market for automatic test equipment (ATE) purchases is currently estimated to be of the order of $200 000 000 American dollars per annum. The case for installation of ATE stations in the production line and in maintenance workshops is usually primarily based on the requirement for a high rate of test capability (to match the product volume flow) or to Bpeed up the test because the time for manual test methods is too high relative to the product MTBF, or because of a shortage of test personnel of the requisite skill level. There are other benefits, and certain disadvantages, as listed in this paper. It is the contention of the present authors that the enormous flow of test data offers an unusual opportunity to management which, if properly exploited, will lead to more efficient industrial production. The paper shows via a particular industrial application, that selective data processing can be used: (a) to assess information content of the current test schedules, so that redundant measurements may be identified and eliminated; (b) to reduce the number of test variables needing to be monitored; (c) to forecast the onset of unacceptable quality levels thereby permitting corrective action to be taken; (d) to highlight changes in quality levels, and by indicating the likely time of onset, to assist in detecting those events causing the change. Thus the paper regards the provision of ATE as an opportunity to provide an extra highly effective feedback link within the management oontrol system. © 1977, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Due to the complexity of the manufacturing environment, problems that can be solved by mathematical programming techniques are usually represented with non-linear programming (NP) models instead of linear programming (LP) models. When non-stochastic vagueness exists between the problem description and its corresponding NP model, fuzzy set theory can be applied to the mathematical model for the purpose of vividly representing the problem. This paper discusses the idea of the fuzzy NP model. Fuzzy set concepts are adapted to the NP objective function and constraints. An identical crisp NP model is derived from the fuzzy NP model for solving the problem numerically. Kuhn-Tucker conditions are addressed to determine the existence of a global optimal solution. A fuzzy machining economics model, which attempts to find optimal manufacturing parameters under vague elements of influence, is used to demonstrate the theory of the fuzzy NP model. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Recently a maintenance policy (so-called ‘on condition’) has increased in importance. Such a policy is based on the systematic control of equipment: preventive action starts on the basis of the information gathered from inspections. To determine an optimal on-condition maintenance policy means to determine the sequence of inspection times which can allow the lowest maintenance intervention and inspection cost. In this paper, the authors show a mathematical model of a nearly optimal inspection policy suitable for production plant equipments. Unlike most previous studies, the model states the hypothesis of two different rates of wear of the equipment, corresponding to two different stages of the failure process, before and after the alarm threshold is exceeded.

It is shown that: (1)A method for the calculation of the control parameters can be worked out.(2)Quantifiable insight into the sort, strength and range of the interactions between the various parts of the flow of goods can be obtained, and(3)Rules of thumb for the control parameters in the various parts of the network can be derived. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The selection of parts and machines poses an important problem in the design and planning phases of cellular manufacturing and flexible manufacturing systems. In most real-life situations, this grouping invariably leads to bottle neck parts and machines. This paper discusses a method of identifying the minimal number of bottle-neck cells (machines or parts) which, when dealt with through either duplication of machines or subcontracting of parts, will result in perfect part- machine groupings with no overlap. The polynomially bounded algorithms used in the analysis are oriented towards finding minimal cut-nodes in either partition of the bipartite part-machine graph. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper represents a real-life case study on the profit effectiveness of maintenance decisions in a Belgian firm which manufactures construction materials on a continuous production line An integrated production—maintenance model was set up to evaluate the output of the production line for different maintenance decisions such, as preventive maintenance frequencies, design out maintenance, maintainability improvements and replacement policies.The changes in gross profit resulting from these decisions were compared with the cost of thg decisions. The idea of profit effectiveness combines the classical sub-optimizations of cost minimization and availability maximization into an overall optimization of the profit of the firm.The paper is an attempt to encourage the use of the profit concept in the area of maintenance management in order to reduce the emphasis put on the cost aspect of maintenance decisions. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For every customer order, the functional specifications which define a product that suits the customer's needs have to be determined. In order to define a bill-of-material (BOM) for every new customer order, these functional specifications have to be related to the engineering characteristics. This requires considerable knowledge about the product and its potential specifications. To support this error-prone task a generic BOM describes a range of products implicitly instead of enumerating the products individually. The importance of the use of a generic BOM is illustrated. The essence of the generic BOM is explained briefly and some of the problem in determining the suitability of a generic BOM are discussed.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Batch production in a flexible manufacturing environment is necessary not only to satisfy some technological constraints but also to achieve potential reductions in processing time, to reduce work-in-process and finished goods inventories, and to simplify the production planning process. Central to batch production is the problem of grouping part types and the required tools into families for simultaneous processing. This paper presents a practical and useful algorithm for grouping parts and tools in flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs).This problem is first formulated as a 0-1 linear integer program. A Lagrangian dual formulation is then developed to obtain an upper bound on the optimal objective function value. The Lagrangian dual program is further decomposed into a linear network subproblem and a set of knapsack subproblems. A subgradient algorithm with several enhancement strategies is employed to minimize the upper bound obtained from the dual problem. Computational results for medium and large-scale problems demonstrate that this solution procedure is effective. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Production planning in flexible manufacturing requires the updating of work schedules each time a new product order is acquired. To this end, a Production Planning (PP) strategy should be devised by solving two coupled problems, embedded into an iteration: (i) Product Orders Scheduling, (ii) Production Capacity Planning. This paper presents a new algorithm to solve the Production Capacity Planning (PCP) Problem for a complex manufacturing system composed of a network of bufferized time-sharing workshops (i.e. shops able to share their service rates among different part types). The solution procedure developed allows one to minimize the Global Flow Time (GFT), while verifying service and storage capacity constraints, in association with a given future pattern of product orders. An example derived from an existing production process is outlined, to show the effective usefulness of the proposed PCP procedure, and its easy integration with existing scheduling tools. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper examines a just-in-time (JIT) system with kanbans with three subassembly lines feeding a final assembly station. Variability in operation times exists and variability effects are reduced by increasing work in process levels or by unbalancing the subassembly lines through assignment of work content at each station. Of the several unbalancing methods that were analysed in this study, only the high-medium-low showed a consistent improvement in the output rate of the JIT production system. The output rates with unbalanced stations were always superior to the output rate of the perfectly balanced configurations used as controls. The extent of improvement over the output rate of balanced systems increased directly with the variability in operation times in final assembly and subassembly stations and inversely with the interstage buffer capacity allowed in the system. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Formation of machine cells often results in some intercellular movements between the cells. These movements cause lack of segregation among the cells. This is in conflict with the main objective of group technology which aims at independently operating cells. This paper presents a non-heuristic network approach to form manufacturing cells with minimum intercellular interactions. The machine-part matrix containing machining times is represented as a network which is subsequently partitioned by using a modified Gomory-Hu algorithm to find a minimum intercellular interaction.

This service-level constraint measures the actual number of stockout episodes and restricts it to a managerially acceptable level.

"One of the most important process parameters in making compound products is the expansion of the bonding surface. Bonding is not obtained until a critical surface expansion, characteristic of the deformation process, is reached. This paper deals with an experimental investigation of the influence of a superimposed hydrostatic pressure on the critical surface expansion during a forging process. The critical surface expansion appears to decrease with increasing hydrostatic pressure. This may be due to the fact that the close contact between the materials necessary to obtain bonding is created by a micro-extrusion of the surfaces into each other. This may explain why the bond strength achieved by different processes, such as forging and extrusion, is quite different for the same value of the surface expansion. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Milling experiments have been performed to investigate the dependence of surface finish s on cutting speed v feed f; and depth of cut d Regression analyses were carried out for a nonlinear model and for a linear model obtained therefrom by logarithmic transformation. The good agreement between the two sets of solutions confirms the adequacy of the model and the linear solution values are therefore commended as suitable ‘initial guesses’ for an iterative solution of the nonlinear case. In addition, small deviations of the 'controlled’ variables from values suitable for coding for a three-level factorial design were found not to be important. Finally, the dependence of surface finish on feed rate f was in fact so weak that the suppression of this parameter had little effect on the exponents of the other parameters. Overall the relationship could therefore be well represented by sα(v/d)15/4. © 1984 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most American firms are concerned with improving their quality. Unfortunately, the current literature does not give a comprehensive theoretical model in order to evaluate each recommendation economically. Because of the lack of a theoretical model and the complexity of quality improvement systems, integrative efforts coordinating marketing and production have been largely ineffective in the strategies of firms, since they have not been subject to traditional cost-benefit analysis. This study develops an integrative strategic quality management theory and a cost-benefit model which put quality improvement programmes into the traditional decision-making framework. Conclusions of this study suggest that quality improvement programmes benefits are cumulative and costs are static. Consequently, evaluation of quality improvement programmes must be dynamic and integrative if they are to be properly evaluated. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The facilities design problem involves the constrained assignment of n facilities to n locations in such a way that the total cost of the design is minimized. All n! feasible solutions for a given problem yield a finite frequency distribution of total costs between absolute lower and upper bounds. The distribution possesses an easily calculable and absolute mean and may often be adequately described by the normal distribution as well as the gamma and Weibull distributions. This paper considers such distributions associated with the facilities design problem and presents a method of calculating the standard deviation using only the basic distance and flow data associated with the problem. The method is accurate for small values of n and yields good approximations for higher values, the quality of the approximation depending on. the ‘ sparseness ’ of the flow matrix. The method proposed is of value to the facilities design engineer when comparing the relative officiences of alternative layouts, or in assessing the performance of a layout design in the dynamic or operational state. © 1976, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Flat Generating System considered has been used on automatic lathes for many years. Its function is to generate parallel flats, squares, hexagons and other regular patterns of flats on turned components as part of the turning operation. Figure 1 illustrates two typical components with hexagons produced by this System. It has been generally accepted that the system does not produce truly flat sides on the form being generated. However there is no apparent evidence than an analysis of the accuracy of the system has been carried out. This may be because under certain established empirical conditions the errors have not been of sufficient magnitude to warrant attention. A preliminary investigation does reveal that varying degrees of error occur with variations in the machining condition and that at a certain stage a change from a concave error to a convex error takes place. On this basis, there would appear to be merit in examining the system with a view to optimizing the machining conditions to achieve maximum accuracy. © 1973 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The influence of mal-alignment on the accuracy of reading for all applications of various types of autocollimator is illustrated by graphs.

"Just-in-time (JIT) production is a philosophy that calls for reducing work-in-process (WIP) inventory to aid process improvement and reduce process variability. In some cases, JIT production has been misinterpreted as a method that would lead to zero or minimal WIP with a lot size of one. There are no models or theories to achieve the JIT goal, i.e. non-stock-production (NSP), and, in particular, to help determine when and where to maintain this minimal inventory. A kanban system acts as the nerve of a JIT production system whose functions are to direct materials just-in-time to workstations in stages of manufacturing, and to pass information as to what and how much to produce. Indeed, the number of kanbans between two adjacent workstations decides the inventory level of that pair of workstations. With the objective of minimizing WIP inventory level, one model dealing with three cases of production configuration is developed for deciding the optimum number of kanbans. The model is then solved using a Markov process approach which considers the demand of finished products as the departure rate and the production rates of stations as arrival rate. In this paper, the model and solution procedure are illustrated with a numerical example. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The paper gives a survey of problems that occur for the gripper system when handling systems are applied in small batches production. In order to solve these problems, a systematic approach is described in the paper. Solutions can be found, for example, in a universal gripper for a whole work-piece spectrum or using gripper changing systems. In order to develop a universal gripper, it is necessary to analyse significant areas on every work-piece type of the whole work-piece spectrum. If it is impossible to design a universal gripper, an automatic moulding gripper could be a possibility. Thus, moulding grippers were developed that use sensors and positioning drives. This paper presents new types of automatic moulding jaws that can be fixed on various grippers. The moulding jaws have been developed as a simple system for moulding purposes in comparison to moulding grippers with sensors and positioning drives.

"It is generally agreed that flexibility in job-shop layouts is a desirable goal which must be planned for in a systematic fashion. Not generally available, however, are procedures by which alternate layout designs can be quantitatively evaluated with respect to the amount of flexibility a particular layout may possess. This paper is concerned with facilities design of job-shop layouts, and analysis of the ability of these layouts to respond to known and future product mixes. The ability of layouts to respond to known and future product mixes is defined as flexibility. Design of a facility is restricted to the spatial arrangement of machines, material-1product storage areas and entrances-exits. An approach is presented which uses annual material handlingtosts that vary from one design to another as a measure of a design's flexibility. The measure is tested on an actual shop and six alternative layouts. The example indicates not only that annual material handling costs can be used successfully as a relative measure of the flexibility a particular layout arrangement possesses, but also that it provides a measure by which the cost: benefit ratio of changing to an alternate design can be evaluated. Guidelines are presented which discuss the limitations and applicability of using this approach to evaluate job-shop layout flexibility. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1980,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During these periods the numbers have to be found together with the production quantities.

"This paper considers the multi-dimensional effects of demand uncertainty (and other environmental characteristics) in connection with a time-phased order- point system in a rolling schedule environment. Recorded performance variables were: the number of stock outs, the maximum stock out in a period, the service level, the inventory level and the number of orders placed. The system was observed under three conditions: no demand uncertainty, demand uncertainty present but no safety stocks and demand uncertainty present with safety stocks to counter its effects. Stock outs, larger inventories and more orders occurred simultaneously when demand uncertainty was introduced in the operating environment. Service levels were reduced and inventory levels increased when forecast errors became larger. Injection of safety stocks to counter the effect of the forecast errors further increased the inventory levels and the order frequency. The dramatic differences between environments with and without demand uncertainty suggest that research findings achieved under deterministic conditions may have little relevance in more realistic stochastic environments. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This paper presents results from a simulation experiment evaluating 14 different single stage lot-sizing procedures. Uncertainty in the form of forecast errors was used as one factor in the experiment. In order to prevent different service levels from confounding cost comparisons, enough safety stock to achieve a 100% service level in all situations was introduced. The ranking of the rules under uncertainty turned out to be very different from the ranking when no demand uncertainty was present. Statistical differences were found between the six best lot-sizing procedures when there was no uncertainty. When forecast errors were present, however, no differences existed for the six best rules in this situation. Thus, uncertainty not only changed the relationship between the lot-sizing rules, but also the character of this relationship. © 1984 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Increasingly robots form part of a complex automation scheme, dictating a requirement for robot control systems which can communicate beyond their local working environment. This paper explains how MAP Version 2·1 broadband local area network interfaces have been used to facilitate robot integration with computer-integrated manufacturing systems and describes integration methodologies which can find widespread application. To illustrate the principles involved a robot-based flexible assembly system has been constructed to assemble and test printed circuit boards. Each machine element of the flexible assembly system has been linked to a MAP backbone through the use of ‘OSI intelligent interfaces’ (or gateways). The interfaces incorporate INI COMMengines and were constructed at Loughborough University to achieve MAP to machine-specific protocol conversion and where appropriate to provide enhanced front-end processing facilities in the locality of machines. The paper also describes the features and use of an AUTOMAtion Integration Language (AUTOMAIL)which is an integration tool which can be used to define information transfer in distributed manufacturing systems. AUTOMAIL allows the system builder to define a number of sequential manufacturing tasks and the necessary synchronization of these tasks. The resulting software accomplishes interprocessor communication on the network through use of MAP application layer primitives and runs on a cell supervisory computer which itself is linked to the MAP backbone. In this way, various application and information architectures have been devised and studied. For example, cell supervisory computers have been used to interpret work-to-lists, generated by factory-wide production planning and control systems, and subsequently control and monitor the integrated functioning of robots, component transport, automatic testing and vision-based inspection systems. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In this paper, a managerial perspective is applied to the traditionally technological problem of yarn wastage in the carpet manufacturing sector. An empirical investigation is carried out to detect the errors arising in the spinning and tufting parts of the production process. A simulation package is then developed to investigate how such errors determine the overall level of waste yam remaining after production. To reduce the level of waste, several strategies involving the use of spare cones are identified. These are evaluated and compared using the simulation as a test-bed. © 1979, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On many machine tools the set-up times are sequence dependent; that is, the time to set-up for the new part is dependent upon the part for which the machine is currently set-up. In scheduling lots on the machine, the set-up time is often a significant component of the total time required to complete each lot. Set-up times are frequently not available to the production scheduler, and when they are, they frequently are only averages which conceal the sequence dependency of the set-up times. In this paper, a procedure is developed that classifies set-up operations and predicts the set-up times. In addition, a method is shown for sequencing the jobs so as to minimize the total set-up time. An example using real world data is used to illustrate these procedures.",1977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Many situations occur in industrial systems, where decisions have to be made from time to time about the manner in which the system shall be operated. This paper concerns a class of situations in which, because of rising costs of operation per unit time, it is necessary to decide when to overhaul the system to minimise long run operating costs. The operating costs are assumed to be a quadratic function of operating time whose parameters are stochastic variables, which is the case with some electrolytic processes. The main purpose is to show how the Dynamic Programming approach can be usefully applied to such systems. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1961,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One possible solution is that of making the cylinder liners in such a way that the modification of local geometry during running-in is kept to a minimum.

"The increase in the number of flexible manufacturing systems is nowadays one of the main trends in the mechanical industry. Because of the complexity of such systems, careful studies are required to make the appropriate design choices in order to avoid an economical disaster. The queueing network theory provides adequate tools to deal with these problems. Most of the analytical models neglect the breakdowns and the maintenance operations which disturb the smooth working of the factory. This paper presents an easy way of modelling these perturbations so that they can be taken into account when evaluating the performances of an FMS (production rate, machine utilization).

"This paper describes a study which investigated the influence that alternate operations might have on the performance of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). An alternate operation might be directed, for example, to avoid a long queue and would, perhaps, be performed by a machine of leaser capability so that a time penalty would be incurred. Three schemes for implementing alternate operations within the hierarchical structure of the FMS are devised and test results are compared with the performance achieved using no alternate operations. Results show that alternate operations can reduce flow (cycle) time (and therefore in-process inventory) while increasing machine utilization. The most effective of the three schemes requires use of multiple levels of the control hierarchy, applying a linear programming model to prescribe production plans and adaptive control to implement the plans over time. © 1985 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Free-machining additions have been added to ferrous and non-ferrous materials for many years. One explanation of their effect in machining is that they reduce the effective interfacial shear strength between chip and tool. A unique friction test was used to measure the fractional characteristics of Cu2Te, Cu2S and Pb coated SAE 1045 steel-high speed steel materials at room temperature. All the coatings showed a reduction in initial torque requirements and this is cited as evidence of the initial low friction characteristics of the films. During the test the effective shear strength of Cu2Te and Cu2S coated material reached that of the uncoated material while the lead coating continued at a low level. It is suggested that this phenomenon is associated with the brittle behaviour of the compound films. © 1976, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",1976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The study of vibration effects on the human body was undertaken twenty-five years ago. Biomechanical models of the human body have since been suggested as a result of several experimental findings. These models (as with any analog system) allow interacting complex phenomena to be represented more exactly and can lead to valuable ergonomic results. They enable, in particular, a dynamic evaluation of seats during steady state vibrations and shocks. Repetitive experiments on the same subject in the same conditions make it possible to obtain a numerical evaluation of the model parameters, although important differences are found between subjects and also for the same subject in varying postures. As a rule, the dynamic properties of the pelvis-table link can be obtained with a satisfactory degree of precision, but for the thorax-pelvis link the dispersion of the experimental results prevents results of general applicability. Finally, it is noted that the mechanical properties of the human body cannot be considered as varying linearly with the intensity of excitation. This makes the reaction to the random stimulations usual in working conditions even more complex. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1964,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mass production of man-operated machines entails that their dimensions should be so designed as to suit the majority of their users. The first part of the paper is devoted to a critical review of work-spaces which demonstrates the discomfort to which certain average individuals are subjected. These individuals are the result of world-wide anthropometric-statistical measurements carried out over a number of years. Ergonomists have widened the conception of work-spaces by introducing improved trial-and-error methods. They have constructed clearance tables for various body regions, as well as manikins to scale and mock-ups of work-spaces, into which certain average individuals were placed. It thus seems that a new method has come into use which integrates ergonomic data concerning body dimensions and the optimal angles between the various body segments. One can, therefore, no longer consider the dimensional adaptation of work-spaces as consisting in the mere application of a series of separate recommendations but one must take into account the complex structure of the entire human frame. Furthermore, this method has the advantage of disposing of biological standards which are irrelevant to engineering practice. and it proposes technical recommendations such as are customary in research departments. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1963,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We consider a generalization of the well-known ‘sawtooth’ inventory control model which is used to determine optimal policies for stocking a single item under certain conditions. The case where several items are to be stocked simultaneously and subject to a number of constraints give rise to the generalization that is of interest. We show that the problem of analysing the model may he viewed as a problem in posynomial Geometric Programming. We then point out some of the advantages to be realized from viewing it this way and from using Geometric Programming techniques to solve it. These include, the ability to obtain feasible solutions with known upper bounds on the difference between their associated costs and the minimum cost, a capability for performing an analysis of the sensitivity of the values of the optimized parameters to variations in input parameters, availability of a solution method that is computationally more attractive than methods previously known and, arising out of this last benefit, an ability to deal with much more complicated problems to which the model is applied than previously seemed practical. A simple example problem is solved in detail to illustrate many of these benefits and results are presented for a much more complex case.

"A maintenance planning and scheduling system often resembles that of a ‘job shop’ that is, the orders are one of a kind, and is characterized by having to schedule N orders through M or less tasks. The orders are of two types, e.g., (a) emergency—have to be done now, and (b) non-emergency—can be delayed until later. In this type of ‘job shop’ the schedule becomes immediately out of date as soon as an emergency order is received. Consequently non-emergency orders are continually moved back in the schedule and forecasted completion dates are not met. Further if the orders entering the system exceed the normal available capacity, the backlog will continue to increase causing more disruption of schedules. The research, which is based on a large petrochemical plant, will deal with the above problems by (a) applying dynamic decision rules for day-to-day scheduling to ensure completion dates are met, (b) a method for controlling backlog, and (c) forecasting future load, and completion dates for orders.

"Acceptance sampling by exponential smoothing presents a concept whereby each lot is accepted or rejected through interrogation of the current lot and all prior lots submitted. The number of defectives of a lot, in conjunction with historical results, is transformed to a quality index by simple exponential smoothing, utilizing larger values of the smoothing constant to lend more weight to the quality of current lots inspected. This quality index is compared with a predetermined threshold index to determine if the lot is to be accepted or rejected. This quality index is then retained to be used as the historical quality information to be applied to the quality index of the next lot. An important feature of the exponential smoothing technique is that an attribute quality can be transformed easily into a measurement quality. This allows the user to select an acceptance quality level at any producer's risk. Further, the OC curve can be forced through any other point by selecting the proper smoothing constant. The obvious limitation in the use of this technique is that the transformed variable—quality index—does not follow a known statistical distribution. This necessitates that simulation methods be used on the digital computer to derive OC curves for specified values of n and α. However, for the conditions of large n and large α, the transformed random variable is approximately normally distributed, giving an approximate normal solution for a plan of interest. It is anticipated that attribute acceptance sampling utilizing any quality index other than proportion defective will be viewed with suspicion by the average user. In this sense the exponential smoothing concept violates a basic precept of Dodge (1955) in that an effective plan must be a simple plan that the non-theoretician can understand and apply with reasonable confidence. However, the flexibility in the selection of OC curves, the utilization of prior lot information, and the ease of application dictate that the concept be given serious consideration as a cost reduction tool in acceptance sampling. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1974,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Group Technology (GT) is one of the key issues in a successful implementation of flexible manufacturing systems ( FMSs). The objective of GT is, through the use of a part-family (PF) formation scheme, to reduce unnecessary variation proliferation. A part family is a group of parts presenting similar geometry and/or requiring a similar production process. Traditional schemes such as classification and coding and production flow analysis do not consider uncertainty or impreciseness in PF formation. In order to incorporate the uncertainty which is inherent in the measurement of similarities between parts, fuzzy mathematics is employed in this research. Two different approaches of fuzzy cluster analysis, fuzzy classification and fuzzy equivalence, are introduced in the process of part-family formation. In addition, a dynamic part-family assignment procedure is presented using the methodology of fuzzy pattern recognition to assign new parts to existing PFs.

The paper also demonstrates that the total buffer capacity should be allocated such that (a) the difference between the production rates of the stages on either side of a storage point is minimized, and (b) the production rate of the stages before the storage point is slightly greater than that of the stages following the storage point. © 1983 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper addresses itself to establishing a practical and accurate automatic detection method of directly measuring damage of a tool without contacting it, using an industrial television (ITV) camera with an auto-focusing device. This newly developed method uses halogen lamps for illuminating cutting tools (in this paper, throw-away tips are examined). Three different images are inputted into a computer by illuminating the tool from three directions. The images are processed, and the tool failures together with the cutting edges are extracted. The computer identifies whether they come from either tool failures or cutting edges using a new image processing technique. The measuring limits of wear/damage are 0-05 mm in length and 0-06 mm2in area. The time required to detect tool damage automatically by this method is about 2 minutes. © 1990 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The paper is an extension of Neuhardt's work which questions the typical assumption that the subsamples used to establish statistical process control charts are uncorrelated. The work was prompted by Neuhardt's work and by checking the data used to determine statistical process charts of ten applications. In all ten situations the data was found to be correlated. Situations where the subsamples are multivariate normals with constant variance and an arbitrary correlation matrix are presented. The rules and equations to determine the control limits of x¯ charts are presented. Simulations are conducted to determine the effect of correlated subsamples on S, R, and S2charts. The output of user-friendly software that performs the necessary computations for establishing x¯, R, S and S2are presented and discussed. © 1990 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This paper describes a rubber manufacturing system and the numerous technological, operating and quality constraints governing its scheduling process. The complex system resembles a flow-shop problem where all jobs share the same general processing order on a progression of machines. The manufacturing system is defined in terms of production stages and parallel processing lines. One stage can process two or more jobs simultaneously. Jobs are often split on the last stage so that two or more parallel processing lines process the same job simultaneously. The scheduling for such a multistage, multiprocessor flow shop is dominated by the quality constraints. A pragmatic approach is provided in which a schedule is constructed through extensive iterations of analysis and simulation. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We describe how the frequency of rescheduling permitted in Material Requirements Planning (MBP) systems influences the impact of safety stock on system costs, and its effectiveness in maintaining desired levels of customer service. The results are obtained from approximate analytical models and simulation studies of a single product with stochastic demand and a two-level product structure. The results indicate that in some cases it may be more economical to reschedule infrequently and use safety stock as protection against demand variations. They also indicate that the effect of changing safety stock levels is much more predictable when rescheduling is infrequent, and that increasing safety stock may actually result in degraded performance when rescheduling is frequent. © 1987 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An open queuing network model with general service times and limited local buffed is developed to evaluate the performance of the flexible manufacturing system (FhIS). The model accommodates two major characteristics of the FBIS, namely. improving machine utilization and reducing work-in-process storage. A 'flow equivalent' decomposition approach is developed to derive approximate solutions to the model. Numerical exam pleasure studied to illustrate the accuracy of the approximations. © 1985 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Local buffers at the work stations in most flexible manufacturing systems have very limited storage capacity and, consequently, parts attempting to enter the work stations may be blocked. Parts routing that follows a dynamic scheme adapted to the state of the system is also desirable. A set of models has been developed to accommodate these features of real systems. The models have easily computable solutions, and with small local buffers are robust to various processing-time distributions. For systems with large local buffers, they can readily incorporate the exponentialization approach to yield accurate results. © 1986 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Several lot sizing rules exist to aid managers in the decision-making process as it pertains to determining the appropriate lot size in a materials requirements planning system! The literature in this area has almost exclusively focused on the single-level lot sizing problem. In this paper, the multi-level lot sizing problem is examined. This study consists of six different demand patterns (master schedules) and four different lot sizing rules. The rules are economic order quantity, least total cost, lot for lot and period order quantity. The study looks at these rules in combination. Therefore, sixteen different lot sizing sequences are examined for each of the six forecasts. Conclusions are drawn as to the relative efficiency of the lot sizing sequences, and suggestions for further research are made. © 1979, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The examination of the economics of multi-pass machining operations has significant practical importance, particularly in the development of algorithms for process planning, and area clearance macros for numerically controlled machine tools. The authors show that, for both turning and milling operations, the optimal widths of cut may usually be evaluated without a knowledge of the relevant tool-life equation. The exception to this finding occurs when either a power or torque constraint is active. The authors demonstrate that in the presence of such constraints the optimal widths can still be evaluated without extensive computation. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is shown that the concept of equivalent chip thickness allows the development. of general rules for the selection of cutting conditions in the two-pass turning operation. The paper is mainly concerned with the formulation of general guidelines for the subdivision of total depth of cut. The results indicate that, in most cases, the cost is minimized when the depth of cut in the initial pass is as great as possible. © 1983 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Computerized visual inspection systems are increasingly being considered and implemented as an alternative to manual inspection and manual gauging in manufacturing systems. Although computer vision systems and image processing have received much attention in the past, statistically powerful, yet computationally efficiency methods still remain to be developed to process the visual information to make computerized inspection systems cost effective. This study investigates the case of inspecting round production parts for shape and size. The statistical properties of the out-of-roundness measurement procedure are investigated. Real-time implementation considerations are discussed. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In order to attain the true integration of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing not only is a smooth flow of information required, but also decision making for both product design and process design must be synthesized. In this paper an integrated design process is proposed in which decisions concerning both product design and process design are simultaneously made. According to the proposed design procedures, an integrated optimization problem is formulated. This optimization is expressed as a multiobjective optimization problem which produces many Pareto optimum solution sets corresponding to combinations of materials used for parts. The algorithm for solving the problem is also presented. The proposed method is applied to designing a cylindrical co-ordinate robot, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of conducting a simultaneous process through product design and process design. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Industrial robots are being used increasingly in complicated working environments where there are obstacles. Industrial robots most suitable for a given working environment should be designed such that they avoid obstacles while moving in the designated working space. In this paper, a design optimization method is proposed for two-degree-of-freedom rotary angular jointed robots for use in such an obstacle-inclusive working environment. In this method, the lengths of the arms and the directional orientation of the robot installation are theoretically determined. First, the algorithmic procedures of the optimization method are presented. Then analytical procedures for obtaining the feasible set of arm lengths are described. Finally, effectiveness of the method is demonstrated for designing a robot used in a given working environment. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The trimming of three-dimensional parts using laser cutting industrial robots is a control challenge, particularly when high speeds and precision are required. The precise control of robot movement along predetermined trajectories is necessary in order to achieve satisfactory quality cuts. This paper focuses on the control system design for direct-drive manipulators for such high-speed trajectory control applications. First, the concept of decoupled and invariant dynamics is discussed for a specific manipulator. Second, a simple procedure of system identification and control system design is presented. It is demonstrated that through arm mechanism design, the control system is greatly simplified and satisfactory control performance is achieved. The arm mechanism design and control system are evaluated through simulations and experiments. The experimental tracking performance achieved is 3 m/s in speed, 3·8g in acceleration with a mean tracking error of 0·055°. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1989,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The allocation of inspection effort problem for aerial systems is formulated as a 0-1 mixed integer linear programming problem. This formulation permits any combination of scrap, rework, or repair at each station and allows the problem to be solved using standard MILP software packages. Moreover electronic spread-sheets may be used to easily calculate the relevant coefficients. An additional advantage of this approach when compared with the traditional dynamic programming approach is the ease with which the basic model may be modified. For example, it is shown how the model may easily be modified to include both a material and a production constraint and to select between various material suppliers. Sensitivity analysis is also easily performed with this approach. This model is then used to show that the optimal inspection policy is dependent on whether a production or a material requirement is used. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Work Measurement procedures for the estimation of the Ratio-Delay and Average Performance Time are reconsidered. The statistical models corresponding to these procedures are formulated in terms of the various sources of variation in worker-production systems. The optimum number of observations for each relevant time period, and the optimum number of time periods are derived in terms of the sampling cost, the available budget and the required confidence intervals for the estimates of the characteristics being measured. © 1961 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

"Optimal power balance in complex systems such as natural gas refineries has been studied by Gignoux, Littauer and Starr for a model of interconnected units whose energy consumption or production is constant and where the system's power requirements fluctuate owing to failure of various units. In the present paper the distribution functions of power requirements are obtained for a similar discrete model and also for a continuous model where the quantities of power consumed or produced are themselves random variables. The optimal balance between power self generated and power purchased from an outside source is derived by application of the distribution functions and illustrated by a numerical example. The method is general and applicable to other systems of power generation. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1963,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This paper is concerned with the strain rate in the milling process at normal running conditions of speed and feed rate and the metallurgical changes on the machined surfaces as associated with it. Experiments are presented in which 0·84% carbon steel specimens were machined by up and down milling methods at cutting speeds ranging from 28 to 90m/min and feed rates ranging from 0·019 to 0·14mm/tooth. Strain rates have been deduced and the effects of speed and feed rate on strain rate are given. Metallurgical examination of the machined surfaces gives a vivid picture of metallurgical changes on these surfaces. Comparison is made between up and down milling regarding these changes. Photomicrographs of some of the machined specimens are included. © 1983 Taylor and Francis Ltd.,1983,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The design and development of an automated system for on-line inspection of components in the press-working industry is described. Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) at a frequency of 5 MHz are used at two separate inspection stations for monitoring the components. Circular metal blanks produced by the first power press are monitored for the presence of burrs, and drawn metal cups formed by the second power press are inspected for the presence of tears produced in the drawing process. Techniques to detect cracks in press tools and assess tool-wear on-line in real-time using compressional and surface acoustic waves are outlined. In addition the feasibility of applying ultrasonic spectroscopy in the above system is examined.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The look ahead dispatching procedure is an approximation method for solving the minimum makespan problem for job shops with routing flexibility. It is a dispatching procedure in the sense that each run of the procedure results in a specification of only one next operation for every machine in the system. The selection of these operations is based on a limited search in the space of possible states the system can reach within approximately twice the average cycle time. This search uses a newly developed representation of the state space, and a newly developed evaluation function. The results are considerably better than those obtained with ordinary priority dispatching rules. In the last section of the paper we discuss how this procedure can be used for the real time control of Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS). © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In this paper an approach to the development of flexible production systems based on GT-principles is described.This approach is conditioned by the relationship between the production system and its environment. It results in the development of autonomous GT cells, or groups. The approach is suitable for both the design of new systems and the redesign of existing production flow systems. The design in autonomous working cells is found by combining modules with different classification codes into groups to fulfill the condition Ti=Z Kt. This combination is based on the possibilities of clamping the parts on the work centres and on the set-up times which are necessary for the change from the module of one code number, to the module of another classification code.The paper is based on an example from a real production system. The procedure which is used to develop autonomous working cells with an increased degree of effectiveness based on given criteria is described. © 1987 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Group technology has been in use in Yugoslavia for a number of years, and considerable experience has been gained in its use in different types of engineering factory. Significant gains have been made by converting to group technology (GT), in productivity, in flexibility, and in the reduction of throughput time and of WIP. The reduction of total stock and the increase in the rate of stock turnover, however, have not been satisfactory, partly due to the high rate of inflation but mainly to the choice of inappropriate methods of production control. We see a need to move towards JIT methods of production control, and have selected period batch control (PBC) as a possible method. This paper describes the existing production control methods in the factories where we are proposing to test the change. It describes the new methods we are proposing to introduce, and it outlines the progressive stage by stage approach which we are planning to use to introduce the change. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Extensive research on the Economic Lot Scheduling Problem (ELSP), and on related topics, has produced powerful techniques originally designed to solve quite specific (coordination) problems. This paper emphasizes the omni-presence of coordination issues in multi-item inventories, characterizes them as problems of staggering and/or clustering replenishment activities or events, and shows how ELSP techniques combine to form a pertinent and fairly comprehensive methodology.

"Dynamic lot sizing heuristics commonly implemented in standard MRP software perform well under conditions of systematic demand only. A survey and numerical test of methods proposed in the literature shows that techniques are available which cope efficiently with both systematic and erratic demand. The paper discusses theoretical and practical ramifications of the dynamic lot sizing problem, surveys heuristics published in the U.S. and West German literature, reports summarily on the findings of extensive simulation experiments involving these heuristics, and, as a conclusion from analytical and numerical results, proposes an algorithm which enhances performance under conditions of erratic demand. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
